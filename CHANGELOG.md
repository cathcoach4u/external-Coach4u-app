# Changelog

All notable changes to the project. The two most recent entries live in `CLAUDE.md`; everything else is here.

---

## v0.5.142
- **Account item added to bottom nav.** User: "the flow needs to be easier to get back to the main accounts page. can we add this as a box next to learn?"
- **What changed:** the bottom nav on every business-level page goes from 5 items to 6 — the new item sits to the right of "Learn":
  ```html
  <a class="bottom-nav-item" href="index.html" title="Back to your account dashboard">
    <span class="bottom-nav-icon">&#x1F3DB;&#xFE0F;</span>
    <span>Account</span>
  </a>
  ```
- **Why:** previously the only one-tap return-to-account-dashboard path was through the navy header `← Back` link, which goes to `business.html` (not `index.html`). For a multi-business account owner, getting back to the dashboard meant either Home → Home (two steps) or remembering to use the browser history. The new `🏛️ Account` slot puts it in the same place as every other navigation pillar.
- **Files patched (22):** `business.html`, `strategy.html`, `operations.html`, `planning.html`, `learning-vault.html`, `core-values.html`, `core-focus.html`, `targets.html`, `marketing-strategy.html`, `leadership-team.html`, `financials.html`, `scorecard.html`, `goals.html`, `meeting.html`, `run-meeting.html`, `issues.html`, `annual-sessions.html`, `run-annual-session.html`, `quarterly-sessions.html`, `run-quarterly-session.html`, `team-checkins.html`, `run-team-checkin.html`.
- **Not patched (correct):** `index.html` (the destination), `account-strategy.html`, `account-operations.html`, `account-planning.html` (account-level hubs — already at the top of the tree). The `account-*` carousel pages use the `.screen-toolbar` pattern rather than the bottom nav, so they're unaffected.
- **CLAUDE.md rule updated:** the nav-order convention now reads "Home / Planning / Strategy / Operations / Learn / Account".
- **No SQL.**

---

## v0.5.141
- **Header layout rework.** User: "move the pill for the drop down out of the main header and put it to the right side of the screen and I want it a square 'pill'. And Your business coach more at the top."
- **Sub-toolbar relocation:** `js/active-org.js` now detects the `#activeBizName` pill on init and, if it's inside `<header class="site-header">`, moves it into a new `<div id="bizSwitcherBar" class="biz-switcher-bar">` inserted right after the header. The move happens once per page load via `insertBefore` — preserves event listeners, dataset attributes, and the v0.5.135 account-override flag. Account-level toolbar pages (those using `.screen-toolbar` instead of `.site-header`) are untouched.
- **CSS:**
  - New `.biz-switcher-bar` — `display: flex; justify-content: flex-end; padding: 8px 16px; background: #f4f6f9; border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb; position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 40;`. Right-aligned content, hides itself when empty.
  - `.biz-pill` border-radius: `14px` → `6px` (square-ish). Padding bumped slightly (6px×12px) and font-size 13px so the new shape doesn't look cramped.
  - Removed the v0.5.124/130 `.site-header:has(.biz-pill:not(:empty)) .header-title { display: none; }` rule — the pill no longer lives in the header, so the title doesn't need to give it space. On phones the title now always shows.
  - `.header-title` font on phones: `1rem` → `1.05rem`, font-weight `700` → `800`. Slightly more prominent on small screens.
- **Compat with v0.5.139 switcher:** `renderBizSwitcher()` runs after `relocatePillToSubToolbar()`, so the `<select>` it builds lives in the sub-toolbar from the start. Click-to-switch behaviour unchanged.
- **Compat with v0.5.135 account override:** the account-scope override (`🏛️ [Account Name]`) still writes to `#activeBizName` — which is now in the sub-toolbar. Same visual result, just relocated.
- **No SQL.**

---

## v0.5.140
- **Manual reordering of businesses.** User asked: "I want to be able to move the order of the businesses." Previously they were sorted alphabetically (by name) wherever they appeared (account dashboard list, v0.5.139 navy header switcher, account-level carousels). Now the order is admin-controlled.
- **`supabase/v0.5.140-delta.sql`** — one column, one index, no RLS change:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE organisations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sort_order int NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS organisations_sub_sort_idx ON organisations(subscription_id, sort_order);
  ```
- **UI on `index.html`**: each biz card now has a small ↑/↓ pair next to the role pill, hidden for non-admins and when there's only one biz. Click swaps `sort_order` between the clicked biz and its neighbour, persists both updates to Supabase, re-renders the list. Top biz's ↑ is disabled; bottom biz's ↓ is disabled.
- **`renderBusinesses()` sort** changed from "alphabetical by name" to "sort_order ASC then name ASC" so ties from default-0 rows resolve sensibly. The first reorder click migrates default-0 rows to distinct values based on their current position.
- **`js/active-org.js`** — the multi-biz switcher dropdown (v0.5.139) now selects `sort_order` and applies the same ordering. Reorder clicks on the dashboard invalidate the `coach4u_biz_list_cache` localStorage entry so the switcher picks up the new order on the next page load.
- **No new pages.** All changes land on `index.html`, `js/active-org.js`, `css/style.css` (one small block of CSS for the `.reorder-btn` style — square 26x26 buttons with subtle hover), and the SQL delta.

---

## v0.5.139
- **Business-switcher dropdown in the navy header.** User feedback: working with a multi-business client account, they wanted to jump between businesses without leaving the page they're on. "If I'm in issues I need to go to each issue for each business with a drop down."
- **How it works:** `js/active-org.js` now detects when the active subscription has 2+ businesses the user is a member of, and converts the `🏢 [Biz Name]` pill (a `<span>`) into a `<select>` listing every business. Picking a different biz from the dropdown calls `activeOrg.set(newOrgId, newName)` then `window.location.reload()` — same page (issues.html / goals.html / scorecard.html / wherever), different business's data.
- **Available on every business-level page** automatically — they all already render the `#activeBizName` pill from `active-org.js`. Single-business accounts don't see the dropdown (no point); the pill stays a plain span.
- **Lazy-loaded Supabase:** active-org.js wasn't tied to Supabase before. Now it dynamically `import()`s the client only when the switcher needs to fetch the business list. No upfront cost on page loads where it's not used.
- **5-minute localStorage cache** (`coach4u_biz_list_cache` keyed by subscription id) so the switcher renders instantly on subsequent pages without re-querying. Invalidated automatically when the account is switched via `setSubscription(...)` (the index.html switcher already calls this).
- **Account-scope override compat:** the v0.5.135 account-pill override (`🏛️ [Account]` on `annual-sessions.html?scope=account`, `quarterly-sessions.html?scope=account`, `team-checkins.html?scope=account`, and the two account-scope session workspaces) now marks the pill `data-overridden="1"`. The switcher checks for that flag and leaves the override alone. If the switcher had already replaced the pill with a `<select>` first, the override swaps it back to a `<span>` showing the account context.
- **CSS:** added `select.biz-pill` rules (appearance:none, inline SVG caret, teal background) so the dropdown looks like the existing pill rather than a native select control.
- **No SQL.** One file (`js/active-org.js`) gained ~70 lines of switcher logic, plus a small CSS addition and one-line marker insertions across 5 account-scope pages.

---

## v0.5.138
- **Promote an issue to a Quarterly Goal.** User asked to "set up the issues and add a button to add the goal on the back of the issues" — the common IDS-on-the-back-of-an-issue flow: discuss issue, decide it's actually a strategic priority, make it a goal.
- **UI:** new teal "Make a goal →" button in the Edit-Issue modal footer (only shown on existing issues, hidden on Add-new since the row needs an ID before it can be promoted).
- **What it does on click:**
  1. Confirms with the user (shows the issue text + current quarter label so they know exactly what they're creating)
  2. Inserts a `rocks` row scoped to the active `organisation_id`: `description` and `owner` copied from the issue, `quarter = current quarter`, `status = on_track`, `company_rock = false`
  3. Marks the source `issue.status = 'resolved'` and writes a solution note: `"Promoted to Q[n] [YYYY] goal: '[description]'"` so the link is visible in the issues archive
  4. Closes the modal, shows a toast, navigates to `goals.html` (800ms later) so the user can finish setting up SMART criteria / status / etc.
- **Falls back gracefully**: if the rocks insert fails (RLS, schema, network), the toast surfaces the Postgres message and the issue is left untouched. If the rocks insert succeeds but the issue update fails, the goal still exists — the issue just won't auto-resolve; admin can mark it manually.
- **No SQL.** Reuses the existing `rocks` and `issues` tables and the v0.5.110+ RLS that lets admins+coaches write both.

---

## v0.5.137
- **Financial Outlook on the Operations one-pager.** User asked: "change the financials for each operations as an annual figure for last year and this year." Strategy one-pager has had financials for a while (v0.5.117 — 12 / 12 months rolling; simplified to totals in v0.5.118); Operations one-pager didn't have any. Now it does &mdash; annual format.
- **Two new strips, both at the bottom between the 3-column body and the footer:**
  - **`one-page-operations.html`** &mdash; single-business doc. Last Year + This Year (YTD), each with Revenue / Expenses / Profit.
  - **`account-ops-plans.html`** &mdash; carousel renders the same strip inside every business card, with the totals scoped to that business.
- **Data source**: reuses the existing `financial_periods` table (no SQL changes). Query `period >= [lastYear]-01-01 AND period <= [thisYear]-12-01`, aggregate by `YEAR(period)`.
  - Last Year = previous calendar year, full-year totals
  - This Year = current calendar year, YTD totals (months already entered)
  - Profit = Revenue &minus; Expenses, coloured teal / red against zero, grey when both inputs are empty
  - Per-row missing data shows "—"; rows where neither was entered get the empty profit treatment
- **Account carousel** adds one parallel query (`financial_periods.in(orgIds)`) when loading; results bucketed per-org client-side into `data.finByYear[year] = { totRev, totExp, anyRev, anyExp }` so each card renders independently.
- **CSS**: copied the `.doc-financials` / `.fin-strip-*` / `.fin-line-*` block from the Strategy one-pager so both ops pages match the look. Print rules added (`page-break-inside: avoid`, tighter padding in print).
- **Trade-off note**: the Strategy one-pager uses *rolling* 12 months (May 25 → Apr 26 last; May 26 → Apr 27 next). The Ops one-pager uses *calendar year* totals (2025 full year; 2026 YTD). Different framings; matches the user's "last year / this year" ask.

---

## v0.5.136
- **Account-scoped session area links now route to the account carousels.** User report from inside an iasHQ account-level session: "the links in the annual session ie targets needs to go to the IAS area, not the outsourcing." The "Open Targets →" link was hardcoded to `targets.html` &mdash; a biz-scoped page &mdash; so it opened whatever business `window.activeOrg.get()` was holding (some other biz like Outsourcing), not the account context.
- **Pattern:** added an `ACCOUNT_LINK_MAP` in both `run-annual-session.html` and `run-quarterly-session.html`:
  - `core-values.html` &rarr; `account-values.html`
  - `core-focus.html` &rarr; `account-focus.html`
  - `targets.html` &rarr; `account-targets.html`
  - `marketing-strategy.html` &rarr; `account-marketing.html`
  - `leadership-team.html` &rarr; `account-leadership.html`
  - `goals.html` &rarr; `account-goals.html`
- A `scopeAreaLinks(areas, isAccount)` helper rewrites the `href` on every area link before render. When `isAccount` is false (biz-scoped sessions), the helper is a no-op &mdash; existing behaviour preserved. When the session has `subscription_id` set and `organisation_id` is null, the map is applied.
- **Why account carousels:** they're cross-business read-only views that already exist (added in v0.5.96; multi-tenant-scoped to the active subscription in v0.5.116). Landing there gives the user the right context for account-level planning &mdash; they can see every business's targets/values/etc. side by side.
- No SQL. UI-only fix on two files.

---

## v0.5.135
- **Account-scope context fix on planning pages.** User report: "iasHQ - click on planning - start a planning day and it's opening the general business." On a closer look the session was being created with the correct `subscription_id` (iasHQ's sub), so the data was right — but the navy header pill still showed whatever business was last active (typically Coach4U from another account), which made the workspace LOOK like it belonged to that biz. Confusing.
- **What changed:** on the three account-scoped list pages (`annual-sessions.html?scope=account`, `quarterly-sessions.html?scope=account`, `team-checkins.html?scope=account`) and their workspaces (`run-annual-session.html`, `run-quarterly-session.html` when the loaded row has `subscription_id` set but no `organisation_id`), the `#activeBizName` element is overridden after init to read `🏛️ [Account Name]` instead of `🏢 [Biz Name]`. Different icon (`🏛️` ≠ `🏢`) so the user can tell account-scope from biz-scope at a glance.
- **Also hidden in account scope:** the ws-hint links at the top of `annual-sessions.html` ("View your current One-Page Plan →") and `quarterly-sessions.html` ("Open Quarterly Goals →") — those point at business-scoped destinations and don't apply when running account-level planning.
- **Account name source:** `window.activeOrg.getSubscriptionName()` (set when the user switches account via the `index.html` switcher in v0.5.111). Falls back to the literal word "Account" if for some reason the name isn't in localStorage yet.
- **No SQL.** Pure UI override on five pages.

---

## v0.5.134
- **Surfaced actual insert errors on the "+ New" buttons.** User reported "the account create planning annual day link start new meeting isn't working" — generic "Could not create session" toast was hiding the real cause.
- **Pattern applied to three pages** — `annual-sessions.html`, `quarterly-sessions.html`, `team-checkins.html`. Now the toast picks the right hint based on the Postgres error:
  - `column subscription_id does not exist` → "SQL not applied — run supabase/v0.5.132-delta.sql"
  - `row-level security` / `policy` → "Permission denied — you need to be the account owner"
  - `violates check constraint` → "Schema mismatch — re-run v0.5.132-delta.sql"
  - Otherwise → the raw Postgres message verbatim
- Also added explicit pre-check: if `IS_ACCOUNT` is true but `subId` is null at click time, the toast reads "No active account — switch account first" instead of going straight to the API.
- Errors also now `console.warn` the full error object (not just `.message`) so DevTools shows the full hint/details for further triage.
- No SQL changes. Pure UX fix for diagnostics.

---

## v0.5.133
- **Hygiene fix to `supabase/schema.sql`.** User hit the error `cannot drop function user_org_ids(uuid) because other objects depend on it ... policy "members read financial_periods" on table financial_periods depends on function user_org_ids(uuid) ... use DROP ... CASCADE` while applying SQL.
- **Root cause:** the error came from running `schema.sql` (the full source-of-truth file) on a populated DB, *not* from `v0.5.132-delta.sql`. The delta file is clean — it doesn't drop user_org_ids anywhere. But `schema.sql` line 59 had `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.user_org_ids(uuid)` without `CASCADE`. That was safe pre-v0.5.117 (no dependents); after the financial_periods table arrived with a policy that uses user_org_ids, the bare DROP fails.
- **Fix:** changed those two DROP FUNCTION lines (user_org_ids and user_admin_org_ids) to use `CASCADE`. Fresh installs are unaffected (nothing to cascade). Accidental schema.sql re-runs on a populated DB now succeed because dependent policies get dropped along with the function, then recreated by the schema.sql CREATE POLICY statements further down.
- **Better practice for the user:** for incremental DB updates, only run the `vX.Y.Z-delta.sql` file for the version being applied. `schema.sql` is the source-of-truth artefact for cold-starting a fresh project, not for migrating an existing one.
- **No new SQL to run** for this hygiene fix unless they want to update their schema.sql copy; the v0.5.132 delta is the only thing that actually needs applying.

---

## v0.5.132
- **Dual-mode planning + new Team Check-ins module.** User asked: should planning live per-business or per-account? Answer: both. Sessions and check-in batches can now be created at either scope; admin picks when creating. Also asked: ability to delete an unintentional meeting; that's in too.
- **SQL — `supabase/v0.5.132-delta.sql`:**
  - **`annual_sessions` / `quarterly_sessions`** — `organisation_id` made nullable; new `subscription_id uuid` (nullable, FK → subscriptions). New CHECK constraint: exactly one of (`organisation_id`, `subscription_id`) is set per row. Existing per-business sessions keep working (organisation_id NOT NULL); new account-level sessions set subscription_id only.
  - **`checkin_batches`** — new table for standalone check-in runs not tied to a planning session. Same dual-scope shape (organisation_id OR subscription_id). Columns: `name`, `run_date`, `invitees jsonb`, `notes`, `status` ('open'/'closed').
  - **`team_checkins.session_type`** — CHECK widened to include `'batch'`. A submitter's row carries their own `organisation_id` (which sub-org they belong to) even when the batch / session is account-scoped.
  - **Two new helper functions:** `public.user_account_ids(uid)` returns all subscription_ids the user has access to (owner OR active member of any org in the sub); `public.user_admin_account_ids(uid)` returns subs where the user is owner OR admin/coach of any org in the sub.
  - **RLS rewritten on annual_sessions, quarterly_sessions, checkin_batches** to handle both scopes — biz rows checked via `user_org_ids` / `user_admin_org_ids`, account rows via the new `user_account_ids` / `user_admin_account_ids` helpers.
  - **`team_checkins` SELECT** policy tightened: rows with `session_type='batch'` are admin/coach-only readable (per user direction "data analysed in one place, admin only"). Annual/quarterly rows stay member-readable as before.
- **Front-end pages:**
  - **New `team-checkins.html`** — list of batches at biz or account scope (via `?scope=account`). "+ New Check-in" modal creates a batch (name + date) and navigates to the workspace.
  - **New `run-team-checkin.html`** — admin workspace for one batch. Editable name / date / status. Invitees list (name + email, no enforcement — informational). "Copy link" share button. Admin notes textarea. Aggregated results table with the 17 questions ranked by lowest-scoring at the top. Delete batch (with confirm — also deletes submitted check-in rows).
  - **`team-checkin.html` (member form)** — now accepts `?batch_id=X&kind=batch` in addition to the existing `?session=X&type=annual|quarterly`. When the session/batch is account-scoped (subscription_id set, no organisation_id), the form looks up the user's first active org in that subscription and uses that as their submitting org_id. Membership verification + duplicate-check logic preserved.
  - **`planning.html` (biz-level hub)** — gained a third card "Team Check-ins" alongside Annual + Quarterly.
  - **`account-planning.html` (account-level hub)** — restructured with two sections: **"Run for the whole account"** (three account-scope cards: Annual / Quarterly / Team Check-ins) and **"Across all your businesses"** (the existing carousel links: annual / quarterly / check-in views per biz, read-only).
  - **`annual-sessions.html`, `quarterly-sessions.html`** — accept `?scope=account` URL param. When set: queries scoped to `subscription_id` instead of `organisation_id`; "+ New Session" inserts with `subscription_id`; header rewires to point back to `account-planning.html`; page title gains "(Account)" indicator.
  - **`run-annual-session.html`, `run-quarterly-session.html`** — detect scope from the loaded row (which scope column is set). Header-back link rewires to the matching scoped list; title shows "(Account)" when appropriate. All workspace functionality (notes, links, commitments from v0.5.131; check-in results; status flip) works identically across both scopes.
- **Meeting delete** — `meeting.html` list view gains a small `×` button beside each meeting row. Click → confirm → `DELETE FROM meetings WHERE id = ?`. RLS lets admins+coaches delete; members can't.
- **Build size:** 3 new pages (team-checkins.html, run-team-checkin.html, v0.5.132-delta.sql) + meaningful edits across ~8 existing pages + schema mirror updates.
- **schema.sql** mirror: partial. The delta is the source of truth for applied changes; schema.sql will be brought fully into sync in a follow-up version.

---

## v0.5.131
- **Improved Annual Planning Session workspace** &mdash; richer capture, less rigid structure. User feedback: "the EOS way is too structured" and "maybe a link to their recording if this is helpful for clients. I don't want to store data &mdash; they can set up external folders and link it to docs for the session."
- **`supabase/v0.5.131-delta.sql`** &mdash; three new columns on `annual_sessions` (all `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, no RLS changes):
  - `notes text` &mdash; free-form session notes
  - `external_links jsonb` &mdash; array of `{label, url}`; defaults to `[]`
  - `commitments jsonb` &mdash; array of `{name, commitment}`; defaults to `[]`
- **`run-annual-session.html`** &mdash; three new blocks inserted between Areas-to-Cover and Team Check-in:
  - **Session Resources** &mdash; "Link to your recording, slides, shared folder, or photos. Nothing is uploaded &mdash; just URLs to your own storage (Google Drive, Zoom, Notion, etc.)" Add/remove rows with label + URL inputs. URL field rendered in teal monospace for visual scanning.
  - **Session Notes** &mdash; "What got decided? What surprised you? What worked, what didn't?" Big resizable textarea, autosaves on input (500ms debounce).
  - **Personal Commitments** &mdash; "What's the one thing each leader will work on this year? These carry into your quarterly sessions." Add/remove rows with name + multi-line commitment. The "One Thing" exercise from the deepened annual guide gets a place to land.
- **CSS additions** for `.row-list`, `.link-row`, `.commit-row`, `.row-input`, `.row-del`, `.row-add`, `.row-empty` &mdash; consistent grid-based row pattern shared between links and commitments. Mobile breakpoint at 540px stacks the URL/textarea below the label/name to one column.
- **Autosave behaviour** &mdash; all three new sections auto-save with a 500ms debounce. Adding or deleting a row saves immediately. Failed saves show a toast.
- **Existing structure preserved** &mdash; the 4-area checklist (Review Last Year, Refresh Core Values + Core Focus, Update 10-Year + 3-Year Outlook, Set 1-Year Plan + Q1 Goals) stays as a lightweight preflight. The new sections are where the actual session substance lives.
- **Scoped to annual sessions only** &mdash; quarterly sessions unchanged for now. Same treatment can be applied later if useful.
- **No file storage.** Per the user: "I don't want to store data." Only URL strings + text are stored; no uploads, no file references, no third-party API integrations.

---

## v0.5.130
- **Dropped all dead Coach4U sample-data seeds from `business.html`'s `ensureSeeds()`.** The strategy seeds went in v0.5.113; this version removes the operations + planning seeds — `coach4u_demo_meetings`, `coach4u_demo_rocks`, `coach4u_demo_scorecard`, `coach4u_demo_issues`, `coach4u_annual_sessions`, `coach4u_quarterly_sessions`. 130 lines of dead code gone. Every page now reads from Supabase; `ensureSeeds()` stays as a no-op stub so the call-site in `init()` doesn't need editing.
- **Rewrote `operations.html`'s "Run Weekly Meeting" button to use Supabase.** It was the last reader of `coach4u_demo_meetings`. Now finds-or-creates a `meetings` row for this Monday (this org + `meeting_date = thisMondayIso`) and navigates to `run-meeting.html?id=…`. Falls back to `business.html` if there's no active org.
- **Mobile keyboard handling.** New `js/mobile-keyboard.js` (~50 lines) wired into all 61 root + learn pages. On touch devices, listens for `focusin` on inputs/textareas/contenteditables, waits ~350ms for the keyboard to animate in, and calls `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })` on the focused field. Adds `body.keyboard-open` while typing so other CSS can react. Skips non-text inputs (checkbox, radio, button etc.).
- **CSS for the keyboard fix** in `css/style.css`: `input, textarea, select, [contenteditable] { scroll-margin-bottom: 260px; }` so the browser leaves room below the input when scrolling it into view; `body.keyboard-open .ws-save-bar { transform: translateY(120%) }` so the sticky save-bar slides out of the way while typing, preventing it from sitting on top of the field.
- **Restored "Your Business Coach" title in the navy header on phones for account-level pages.** User reported the navy bar on `index.html` was empty on first launch — just "Sign Out" on the right with nothing on the left. The v0.5.124 hide-on-phones rule was too broad. New rule uses CSS `:has()`: `.site-header:has(.biz-pill:not(:empty)) .header-title { display: none; }` — title only hides when a populated biz pill (business-level page) is competing for space. Account-level pages (no biz pill) now show the title. Title font tightened to 1rem on phones.
- **No SQL.**

---

## v0.5.129
- **VB2 source arrived &mdash; deepened the two guides that couldn't be fully audited against a source in v0.5.126.** User uploaded `EOS-VB2-Implementer-Guide.pdf` (2.5MB, the real PDF) which had previously been a 2-byte stub. Moved it to `/EOS/2022-07-14_EOS-VB2-Implementer-Guide.pdf` to match the rest.
- **`learn/marketing-strategy.html` &mdash; rewritten from ~200 to ~700 words.** Was audited as "SOLID (within what's verifiable)" but the source was missing. Now matches VB2 depth:
  - **DGP framework** &mdash; Target Market via Demographic + Geographic + Psychographic, leading to "The List" as a finite, named filter
  - **Rule of 7** &mdash; customers need to hear the message 7+ times before they hear it for the first time
  - **3 Differentiators competitor test** &mdash; "every competitor may do one or two; you're the only one that does all three" (Southwest Airlines 3LFs example)
  - **Process and Guarantee as YES/NO decisions** &mdash; decide today, then either commit to building it as a future quarterly goal, or remove from the plan; no half-measures
  - **Common pitfalls** specific to each of the four: target-too-wide, adjective differentiators, sales-funnel as Process, toothless guarantee
- **`learn/targets.html` &mdash; tightened the 3-Year and 1-Year sections with VB2 facilitation details.** The agent flagged these as partial (no source) in v0.5.126:
  - **"Shot over the bow then debate"** framing for every number (Revenue / Profit / Measurables)
  - **3-Year specific bullet prompts**: # employees + right-people-right-seats, # clients, locations, new products, marketing efforts, your own role
  - **5&ndash;15 surviving bullets** target with "err on the side of leaving something on the list"
  - **The see-it / want-it / believe-it three-question test** at the end of 3-Year (previously had only "do you see it?")
  - **Each person shares their role** at end of 3-Year &mdash; no discussion &mdash; to surface misalignment
  - **1-Year quiet-time prompt** explicitly references the 3-Year Outlook + Issues List + Org Chart as the inputs
  - **One-at-a-time onto the board** rule for 1-Year goals (don't batch &mdash; weak goals survive in noise)
  - **Full closing read-back** &mdash; "If we're sitting here on [date] with this revenue, profit, measurables, and we have achieved goal #1 [name], goal #2 [name]&hellip; will that have been a great year?"
- Built via one-shot Python (`_deepen_vb2.py`, deleted after run). No SQL. No EOS trademark terminology in user-facing copy &mdash; the v0.5.116 wording rules still apply (Niche stays as a worksheet field name but is generic enough).

---

## v0.5.128
- **Fixed a wording bug in the Annual Planning Session guide's Coach's tip.** User caught it: the tip read "If you wait, it'll slip into a busy quarter, then slip again" &mdash; recycled language from the Quarterly tip that doesn't fit the annual cadence (annuals slip across years, not quarters). Rewrote: "If you wait, the date gets eaten by busy quarters and the year quietly disappears."
- One-line front-end fix. No SQL.

---

## v0.5.127
- **Removed the standalone Values Discovery exercise.** User feedback: "I don't think the run the values guide is needed. It's just not helpful compared to the comprehensive other document." Agreed — the 3-step interactive page (~430 lines) was always a slimmer take, and the deepened Core Values guide (v0.5.125) now contains the full facilitated exercise with timings and steps anyway. Two doors to the same room, where one is the better door.
- **Changes:**
  - Deleted `learn/values-discovery.html` (the 3-step interactive page).
  - Removed the "Run the Values Discovery exercise" ghost button from `learning-vault.html`'s Core Values card. The card now shows two actions: `Read the guide →` (primary) and `Open worksheet` (ghost).
  - Removed the "Run the Values Discovery exercise" primary CTA from the bottom of `learn/core-values.html`. The CTA row now shows just `Open the Core Values worksheet →` (primary, teal). Reading the guide and running the exercise are now the same thing — the guide is the script.
- **Verified zero orphan references** to `values-discovery.html` across `*.html` and `learn/*.html`.
- **No SQL.**

---

## v0.5.126
- **Deepened the 9 remaining light Learning Vault guides** to match the depth of v0.5.125's Core Values rewrite. The parity audit (run in v0.5.125) found 6 TOO LIGHT and 3 LIGHT guides versus the EOS implementer source docs in `/EOS/`. Each is now a real how-to playbook with the actual exercise the facilitator runs, not a concept summary.
- **What's now in each guide** (the patterns the audit flagged as universally missing):
  - **Silent-write-then-share-around-the-table** facilitation pattern at the start of every exercise
  - **Keep / Kill / Combine** voting mechanic (colour-coded where relevant)
  - **Closing read-back or visualisation checks** ("when this is done, will it have been a good X?", "close your eyes — do you all see it?")
  - Explicit **timings per step** so the session can be run to the clock
  - The **specific prompts** that elicit good answers (e.g. the "desert-island" prompt for the scorecard, the "100 of them" prompt for values)
- **What each guide gained:**
  - **Core Focus** — silent-write / stir-the-pot / 80% consensus sequence; 4 Purpose archetypes (Solving / Helping / Building / Winning); "client × problem × outcome" Niche test
  - **Targets** — three sub-exercises (10-Year / 3-Year / 1-Year) each with their own steps; the close-eyes test on 3-Year; the budget-support check on 1-Year; cascade to departmental plans
  - **Leadership Team** — two ground rules (forward 6–12 months; no people yet); three major functions + Integrator; LMA rule (Lead / Manage / Accountability); fit test (understands / wants / capacity); the 3 yes questions
  - **Quarterly Goals** — Big Rocks (Covey) + laser focus framing; full 7-step exercise (silent → board → K/K/C colour-coded → star round → SMART → first step → read-back); don't-erase-the-killed-list rule
  - **Weekly Numbers** — the 8 reasons every leader needs a number; desert-island prompt; two-job test (pulse + predict); lead vs lag filter (≥ 50% leading)
  - **Weekly Meeting** — the 5-point cadence rule; explicit "drop it down" principle for the front of the agenda; 90%-of-todos-dropping-off rule; cascading messages in conclude
  - **Issues** — full 3-step Identify/Discuss/Resolve protocol with examples; the 80% rule + "disagree and commit"; 30-second prioritisation ritual
  - **Quarterly Planning Session** — 9-step agenda with timings; 80% completion target; operating-system health check across 6 components
  - **Annual Planning Session** — 2-day structured agenda (Day 1: where are we / Lencioni 5-Dysfunctions / One Thing / SWOT; Day 2: 3-Year / 1-Year / Q1 / cascade); the One Thing exercise (60 min) called out as highest-leverage of the two days
- **No EOS trademark terminology** in user-facing copy — the wording rules from v0.5.116 still apply. The methodology comes from the EOS implementer guides; the Lencioni 5-Dysfunctions framework and Covey's Big Rocks metaphor are non-EOS public sources cited directly. The DB table name `rocks` keeps its name; UI text reads "Quarterly Goals".
- **3 guides left unchanged** per the audit:
  - `marketing-strategy.html` — verdict SOLID; VB2 source (where Marketing Strategy is taught in EOS) is a 2-byte stub in the repo, no docx fallback, so couldn't deepen against a source.
  - `financials.html` — no EOS counterpart (financials aren't a separate EOS tool).
  - `team-checkin.html` — Organizational Checkup source not in the repo.
- **Built via a one-shot Python rewrite script** (`_deepen_guides.py`, deleted after the build) — each guide's body sections + tip body replaced in place, preserving the smart-back-link header (v0.5.122) and the bottom CTA row.
- **No SQL.** Pure content build.

---

## v0.5.125
- **Rewrote `learn/core-values.html` to match the depth of the original EOS implementation experience.** User feedback: "Check again at the activities especially the values one as I think the one written is a little light on." Confirmed by re-reading the EOS VB1 (Vision Building Day 1) Implementer Guide — the Core Values exercise in that document is a 2-hour structured group exercise; my guide had compressed it to 4 bullet points.
- **What's now in the guide** (~800 words, up from ~200):
  - **The "100 of them" prompt** as the starting point — name 3 people you'd want 100 of, not 3 best people. The framing is what makes it work.
  - **The 5-step exercise flow** with timings: silent listing → characteristics on the board → first Keep/Kill/Combine pass (down to 10–15) → break → apply traps → second pass (down to 3–7) → test.
  - **Lencioni's three value traps** with a test for each: Accidental (emerged from a past or partial subset), Aspirational (you wish, you don't), Permission-to-play (generic table-stakes any competitor could claim).
  - **The People Test** — score 3–5 real team members 1–5 against each draft value; real values differentiate (stars high, bottom-end low).
  - **The Five-Use Test** — would you actually use this to hire / fire / review / reward / recognise? If not five out of five, it's not a value.
  - **Updated Common Pitfalls** — skipping the people-listing, doing it solo, trying to land it in one pass, wordsmithing too early, too many.
  - **Coach's tip** rewritten to emphasise the hiring use of values + the cost of letting in a single low-scoring hire.
- **Source**: the EOS VB1 Implementer Guide (`EOS/2023-04-27_EOS-VB1-Implementer-Guide(1).docx`), Core Values section pages 17–20. The methodology is faithfully translated; **no EOS trademark terminology is used in user-facing copy** (the v0.5.116 rules still apply). The Lencioni value-trap framework is from Patrick Lencioni's 2002 HBR article *Make Your Values Mean Something* — not EOS-specific, so the framework name and trap names are kept as-is.
- **CTA order swapped on the guide** — "Run the Values Discovery exercise" is now the primary action (teal), worksheet is secondary (ghost). The exercise is the way to discover values; the worksheet is where you commit them once known.
- **Parity audit running in background** for the other 12 guides against their EOS source docs. Results inform v0.5.126.
- **No SQL.**

---

## v0.5.124
- **Decluttered the navy site-header on phones.** User feedback: "The top blue header looks too busy now on phone." Four elements were competing inside a ~390px iPhone bar: back link, "Your Business Coach" title, 🏢 biz pill, Sign Out — plus their gaps. Reading as cluttered.
- **Hid `.header-title` (the "Your Business Coach" wordmark) at ≤ 640px** — `display: none` in the mobile media query. The brand is preserved everywhere else: the PWA icon + name on the user's home screen, the body `<h1>` on every page that names the activity, and the back link that names the section. Removing the redundant third copy from the navy bar gives the back link + biz pill + sign-out room to breathe.
- **Minor tighten while in there:** mobile header padding 12px → 10px vertical; biz pill `max-width` 110 → 160px at 480px and 90 → 120px at 400px (so long business names truncate less); back-link font 12 → 14px (less eye-strain).
- **Tablet/desktop header unchanged** — the full `← Back · Your Business Coach · 🏢 Biz · Sign Out` row stays above 640px.
- **No SQL.** Single CSS change in `css/style.css`.

---

## v0.5.123
- **Fixed the broken PWA install.** User screenshot of "Add to Home Screen" dialog showed the app name as "Coach4U" with a generic auto-generated "C" letter avatar, URL truncated to `cathcoach4u.github.io/exte…`. Three things were wrong:
  - **`manifest.json` had stale paths.** `start_url`, `scope` and the two icon `src` values all pointed at `/external-Coach4u-app/` (the old repo path). The site lives at `/yourbusinesscoach/`, so iOS launched the installed app at a 404 and couldn't load the icon — falling back to its auto-generated letter avatar. Rewrote with relative paths (`./`, `./icon-192.png`, `./icon-512.png`) so the manifest works on any hosting URL.
  - **`apple-touch-icon` missing on most pages.** Only `business.html` and `setup.html` declared the link, and both pointed at `favicon.svg`. iOS Safari doesn't reliably honour SVG as a home-screen icon; it needs a PNG. Added `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="apple-touch-icon.png">` to every page (57 files: every root HTML + every `learn/` guide).
  - **No PNG icons existed.** Generated three from a Python/Pillow script that matches the brand: 180×180 (`apple-touch-icon.png`, what iOS uses for home-screen), 192×192 and 512×512 (manifest icons, what PWA installers + Android Chrome use). Design: navy rounded square with diagonal gradient + subtle decorative circle, white **B** and teal **C** centred (per user request, "BC such as Business Coach"). Also updated `favicon.svg` to the same BC mark so the browser tab matches.
- **`offline.html`** had `window.location.href='/external-Coach4u-app/'` baked into its "Go to home" button — fixed to use relative `./`.
- **Service-worker cache version bumped** to `coach4u-v0.5.123` so iOS picks up the new manifest + icons on the next visit. The user will need to **remove the existing app icon from their home screen and Add to Home Screen again** — iOS aggressively caches PWA icons and won't update them in place.
- **No SQL.**

---

## v0.5.122
- **Smart "back" link on every Learning Vault guide.** User feedback: "It says back to learning vault but if you have opened it from the sections you need to go back to the section you have opened it. But good to also go to learning vault." Two paths in, one path back wasn't right.
- **The pattern**: on guide page load, check `document.referrer`. If the visitor came from the matching worksheet/tool (e.g. they clicked `Read the Quarterly Goals guide →` from `goals.html`), swap the header back link from `← Learning Vault` → `← Quarterly Goals` and point it at `../goals.html`. If they came from the Vault index (or from anywhere unrecognised), the link stays `← Learning Vault`. Brief flicker on the swap is acceptable — the JS runs at the top of `init()` before the auth check.
- **Mapping per guide** (the parent worksheet/tool each guide checks for as its "came from" source):
  - Strategy guides → their matching worksheet (`core-values.html`, `core-focus.html`, `targets.html`, `financials.html`, `marketing-strategy.html`, `leadership-team.html`).
  - Operations guides → their matching tool (`goals.html`, `scorecard.html`, `meeting.html`, `issues.html`).
  - Planning guides → their session list page (`quarterly-sessions.html`, `annual-sessions.html`, `planning.html` for team check-in).
- **Wiring**: each guide's `<a class="header-back">` gained two data attributes (`data-worksheet-href`, `data-worksheet-label`) and a small synchronous swap snippet at the top of `init()` that reads them, compares the filename of `document.referrer` against the worksheet href, and rewrites the link if they match.
- **Bottom `← Back to Learning Vault` link unchanged** — that's the always-on Vault path the user explicitly wanted to keep. The primary teal `Open the worksheet →` CTA also stays, so the user can move forward into the activity even if they came from somewhere else.
- **Built via a one-shot Python patch** across all 13 guide files so the wiring stays uniform. No SQL.

---

## v0.5.121
- **Deep-linked the in-page Vault tip box** on every worksheet and operations tool to its specific guide. User feedback from inside `goals.html`: "There is a click button in there taking me to the learning area. This is a generic link and doesn't connect to the specific activity. Wouldn't it be better to go to the specific activity area." Yes — fixed.
- **Mapping** applied to 10 pages:
  - `core-values.html` → `learn/core-values.html`
  - `core-focus.html` → `learn/core-focus.html`
  - `targets.html` → `learn/targets.html`
  - `financials.html` → `learn/financials.html` (had no Vault link before; added one)
  - `marketing-strategy.html` → `learn/marketing-strategy.html`
  - `leadership-team.html` → `learn/leadership-team.html`
  - `goals.html` → `learn/quarterly-goals.html`
  - `scorecard.html` → `learn/weekly-numbers.html`
  - `meeting.html` → `learn/weekly-team-meeting.html`
  - `issues.html` → `learn/issues.html`
- **Link label tightened too.** Was "Explore [topic] exercises in the Learning Vault →" (vague, sounded like a placeholder). Now "Read the [Activity Name] guide →" (specific, action-oriented, matches the Vault index button label so the user knows it's the same thing).
- **Bottom-nav "Learn" tab still goes to the Vault index** (`learning-vault.html`) — that remains the entry point for browsing all activities. Only the in-page contextual tip box deep-links.
- **Workspaces** (`run-meeting.html`, `run-annual-session.html`, `run-quarterly-session.html`) don't have an in-page Vault tip box and weren't changed — the read-the-guide framing fits worksheets, not in-flight workspaces.
- **No SQL.** Pure content/link tidy.

---

## v0.5.120
- **Wrote actual content for every Learning Vault guide.** User pushback on v0.5.119: "I don't see what value you have offered. The links don't go to the actual page — they still must go for [the] Learning Vault." Fair criticism — v0.5.119 indexed the activities but the "Read guide" buttons were grey "Coming soon" placeholders, so the Vault was just a launcher pointing back to pages already reachable via the bottom nav. No new value.
- **13 new guide pages** under `learn/<slug>.html`, one per activity in the program:
  - **Strategy** — `core-values`, `core-focus`, `targets`, `financials`, `marketing-strategy`, `leadership-team`
  - **Operations** — `quarterly-goals`, `weekly-numbers`, `weekly-team-meeting`, `issues`
  - **Planning** — `quarterly-planning-session`, `annual-planning-session`, `team-checkin`
- **Guide template** — uniform structure across all 13: eyebrow (section · GUIDE), title with icon, one-line tagline, then four sections (What this is / Why it matters / How to do it well / Common pitfalls), a teal `Coach's tip` callout, and a CTA row with `Open the worksheet →` primary + `← Back to Learning Vault` link. Auth-gated like the rest of the app. Loads `active-org.js` so the business pill still shows in the header.
- **Content style** — direct, no fluff, no EOS jargon. Each guide ~250-400 words. The "How to do it well" sections are numbered steps the user can actually execute; "Common pitfalls" calls out the specific failure modes; "Coach's tip" is the one piece of advice that\'s most often missing.
- **Vault index rewired** — every card's primary CTA changed from `Open worksheet` (live) → `Read the guide` (live, links to `learn/<slug>.html`). The worksheet link drops to a secondary ghost button. The Core Values card keeps `Run the Values Discovery exercise` as a third ghost button alongside.
- **Built via Python script** (`_build_guides.py`, deleted after the build) — the content lives in a single Python dict so all 13 stay structurally consistent. Regenerating is easy if the template needs to change later.
- **No SQL, no schema.** Pure content build.

---

## v0.5.119
- **Rebuilt the Learning Vault as a structured activity index** mapped to the full Coach4U program. User asked: "all the activities that align to the full program."
- **13 activities, 3 sections:**
  - **Strategy — the foundations** (6): Core Values, Core Focus, Targets, Financials, Marketing Strategy, Leadership Team.
  - **Operations — the weekly cadence** (4): Quarterly Goals, Weekly Numbers, Weekly Team Meeting, Issues.
  - **Planning — the longer rhythm** (3): Quarterly Planning Session, Annual Planning Session, Team Check-in.
- **Each card has two CTAs side by side:**
  - A solid teal `Open worksheet / Open Quarterly Sessions / Run the Values Discovery exercise` — links straight into the live page in the app. The user can jump from the index directly into doing the activity.
  - A grey disabled `Read guide · Coming soon` — reserves the slot for written guides (no clutter, but the user can see what's coming).
- **The one existing guide** — `learn/values-discovery.html` (the 3-step Core Values exercise) — is surfaced as the secondary CTA on the Core Values card, instead of as a separate "Guided Exercises" section. Keeps the cards uniform.
- **Section blurbs** give a one-line framing for each group ("Set once, review every quarter — together these make up your One-Page Plan", etc.) so the index doubles as a quick orientation to the program structure.
- **Card design** is one column on mobile, one card per activity (icon + name + 2-line description + 2 buttons). No more "Coming Soon" cards that look broken — every card has at least one live action.
- **No SQL, no schema.** Pure front-end rewrite of `learning-vault.html`.
- **Open question for the next pass:** when the written guides ship, each will live as a new `learn/<activity>.html` page. The grey `Read guide` ghost button on the matching card becomes a live teal link. No structural changes needed to the Vault index when each guide arrives — just swap the ghost button for an anchor.

---

## v0.5.118
- **Simplified the Financial Outlook strip** on `one-page-plan.html` and the `account-plans.html` carousel. User feedback: "change figures to just show the final numbers not each month."
- **Before**: 12 month-rows + a totals row, with Month / Rev / Exp / Profit columns — quite dense.
- **After**: just the 12-month totals as three lines per side — Revenue, Expenses, Profit. The date range still shows in the column heading (e.g. *Last 12 Months · May 25 → Apr 26*) so the reader knows what the totals cover.
- **Replaced**: the `<table class="fin-mini">` mini-table + the `buildTable()` row-by-row builder is gone. Now a `<div class="fin-totals">` containing three `.fin-line` rows (Revenue / Expenses / Profit), with the profit line teal/red against zero and grey when both columns are empty.
- **CSS replaced**: removed the `.fin-mini` table styles and added `.fin-totals` / `.fin-line` / `.fin-line-label` / `.fin-line-value` (plus `.fin-line-profit` colour variants). Print rules updated accordingly.
- **Worksheet unchanged**: `financials.html` still lets the admin/coach enter month-by-month figures across the 24-month window — the simplification is display-only on the printed one-pager.
- **No SQL changes.**

---

## v0.5.117
- **Monthly financials added to the one-page plan.** User asked: "Does the one-page plan have revenue/expenses for the next 12 months? If not, this needs to be added. And list the last 12 months if figures available."
- **New `financial_periods` Supabase table** (`supabase/v0.5.117-delta.sql` + mirror in `schema.sql`):
  ```
  financial_periods (id, organisation_id, period [date, first-of-month],
                     revenue numeric, expenses numeric, created_at, updated_at,
                     UNIQUE (organisation_id, period))
  ```
  RLS mirrors the rest of the strategy tables: SELECT by active org members (via `user_org_ids`), INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE by admins + coaches (via `user_admin_org_ids`). Multi-tenant safe — every query is `eq('organisation_id', orgId)` and the account-level carousel scopes to the active subscription.
- **New worksheet `financials.html`** — linked from Strategy as a new `Financials` card. Renders 24 month-rows in two grouped tables: **Last 12 Months** (actuals) above **Next 12 Months** (forecast; current month sits at the top of the future block). Each row: month label + revenue input + expenses input + auto-computed profit. Inputs auto-save on each keystroke (500ms debounce) and immediately on blur via `upsert` against the `(organisation_id, period)` unique constraint. Totals row at the bottom of each table sums Rev/Exp/Profit with teal/red colouring. Inputs accept raw numbers — the helper strips `$` / commas / `K` etc. Profit auto-calculates per row and live-updates the section totals as you type.
- **`one-page-plan.html` extended** with a new **Financial Outlook** strip between the existing 3-column body and the footer. Two compact mini-tables side by side — Last 12 / Next 12 — month × Rev × Exp × Profit with totals. Months print at 0.62rem (smaller in print mode). Empty cells render as grey "—". Loads `financial_periods` via a 6th parallel query in the existing Promise.all. Empty state at the top of the strip: "No figures recorded yet — fill in Strategy → Financials."
- **`account-plans.html` carousel extended** to render the same financial strip inside every business card. The carousel fans out one extra `financial_periods` `.in('organisation_id', orgIds)` query, bucketed per-org client-side, so all businesses' financials load in a single round-trip. Each carousel card shows that business's own last 12 + next 12. Print rules updated so the financial strip stays on the same A4 page as the rest of the doc.
- **`strategy.html`** card grid gained a teal `💰 Financials` card linking to `financials.html`. Also tidied the Targets card description: "10-year vision, 3-year picture and 1-year plan" → "10-year vision, 3-year outlook and 1-year plan" (catching a leftover from the v0.5.116 EOS sweep).
- **`CLAUDE.md`** updated: `financials.html` added to the file structure, `financial_periods` added to the Strategy tables list.
- **Re-run required:** `supabase/v0.5.117-delta.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor before testing. The CREATE is idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`) and the policies are `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` + `CREATE POLICY` so re-runs are safe.

---

## v0.5.116
- **Full multi-tenant scoping sweep.** User asked: "Do a full audit to check all." The v0.5.111 multi-tenant work scoped the dashboard (`index.html`), v0.5.115 backported the fix to `account-plans.html` and shipped the new `account-ops-plans.html` already scoped. The remaining **12 account-level carousel pages** had the same pre-existing leak: their `team_members` query pulled every business the user was a member of, mixing client accounts together. Fixed in: `account-numbers`, `account-goals`, `account-meetings`, `account-issues`, `account-values`, `account-focus`, `account-targets`, `account-marketing`, `account-leadership`, `account-annual`, `account-quarterly`, `account-checkins`. Each now loads `js/active-org.js` and filters by `organisations.subscription_id = activeSub.id` when an active subscription is set. All 12 patched with one Python sweep so the wording is identical and the pattern is stable.
- **EOS de-jargoning.** User asked: "check the wording for EOs and change anything that sounds like EOs". Audited every HTML/JS/CSS file. Removed verbatim EOS terminology from user-facing copy:
  - `learning-vault.html`: "How to Run Level 10 Meetings" → "How to Run Weekly Team Meetings" (90-minute reference dropped); "3–7 quarterly Rocks" → "3–7 quarterly priorities".
  - `run-meeting.html`: agenda item 4 "Customer & Employee Headlines" → "Customer & Team Highlights"; agenda item 6 "Issues — Identify, Discuss, Solve" → "Issues — Discuss & Resolve".
  - `marketing-strategy.html`: "Our three uniques are…" → "What makes us different is…"; "Our Proven Process" → "Our Process".
  - `targets.html`, `one-page-plan.html`, `account-targets.html`, `account-plans.html`: "3-Year Picture" → "3-Year Outlook" (4 files).
  - `run-annual-session.html` area card: "Update 10-Year + 3-Year Picture" → "Update 10-Year + 3-Year Outlook".
  - **The 17 team-checkin questions** (identical block in `team-checkin.html` / `run-annual-session.html` / `run-quarterly-session.html`) rewritten end-to-end. Position and meaning preserved so the 1-5 scores stored in `team_checkins.scores` still map to the same conceptual statement, but the wording dropped: "Accountability Chart", "right seat" / "right people" / "get it, want it, capacity" (GWC), "Quarterly Projects", "Annual Meetings", "10-Year Target", "3-Year Target", and the "(core business)" / "(big, long-range business goal)" / "(organisational chart...)" parenthetical EOS glosses.
  - The DB table name `rocks` stays — renaming it would require an SQL migration touching every read/write path. The UI surfaces it as "Quarterly Goals" everywhere, which it already did.
- **`CLAUDE.md` substantially refreshed** to match current state. The "Data layer (localStorage demo stub)" section was deeply stale — every strategy worksheet and operations tool moved to Supabase several versions ago. Rewrote the data-layer section, file structure (added `one-page-operations.html`, `account-ops-plans.html`, every account-* page), Current Status, and the Architecture section. Renamed "Planned Architecture (Supabase Migration)" to "Architecture (Supabase + Multi-Tenant)" since the migration is done. Added a Multi-Tenant section documenting the active-subscription scoping pattern that every account-level page must follow. Added a "Wording / Tone" section banning EOS terms going forward. The Pricing Model + role definitions updated to include Coach (v0.5.110).
- **No SQL changes** in this version. All edits are front-end + docs.

---

## v0.5.115
- **New `account-ops-plans.html`** — the account-level companion to `one-page-operations.html` (v0.5.114). User asked: "is this added to the account level as well?" — it wasn't, now it is. Mirrors the existing strategy pattern: `one-page-plan.html` is the per-business strategy doc, `account-plans.html` is the carousel of all businesses' strategy docs; `one-page-operations.html` is the per-business ops doc, `account-ops-plans.html` is the carousel of all businesses' ops docs.
- **Carousel mechanics** — copied directly from `account-plans.html`: prev/next buttons with hint of the next business name, dots, keyboard arrow nav (don't hijack while typing), wraps at the ends.
- **Per-business render** — same 3-column doc as v0.5.114 (Quarterly Goals · Weekly Numbers · Open Issues), one card per business, doc-header carries the business name + today's date.
- **Data layer** — fans out 3 parallel queries (`rocks`, `scorecard_metrics`, `issues`) `.in('organisation_id', orgIds)` for all loaded businesses, plus one `scorecard_entries` query across every metric. Result is bucketed back per-org client-side. Reads the current quarter (`Q{n} {year}`) for rocks; reads the last 6 Monday-anchored weeks for the scorecard.
- **Multi-tenant scoping** — the membership query has `.eq('organisations.subscription_id', activeSubId)` when an active subscription is set, so a user who owns SARUBA + Acme + … only sees the businesses inside the currently-selected account. The active subscription is read via `window.activeOrg.getSubscription()` (added by v0.5.111).
- **Same scoping fix backported to `account-plans.html`** — that strategy carousel had the same pre-existing leak: without subscription scoping it pulled every team_membership the user had, mixing businesses across all their client accounts into one strip. Added the `if (subId) memQuery.eq('organisations.subscription_id', subId)` filter, plus loaded `js/active-org.js` (which it wasn't previously). The 11 other `account-*.html` carousel pages have the same bug and should get the same fix in a subsequent pass; out of scope for this version since the user's ask was specifically about the operations one-pager.
- **Linked from `account-operations.html`** via a new "View One-Page Operations — All Businesses" `.view-plan-btn` (style added inline, mirroring `account-strategy.html`).

---

## v0.5.114
- **New `one-page-operations.html`** — parallel to the existing `one-page-plan.html` (which covers strategy). User asked: "create a one page plan to house the goals, weekly numbers and the issues, similar for the one page plan."
- **Layout** — landscape A4, three columns of equal-ish weight (`1fr 1.55fr 1fr`):
  - **Column 1 — Quarterly Goals**: every row in `rocks` for the active org + current quarter (`Qn YYYY`), ordered by `sort_order`. Each goal shows status icon (🟢🟡🔴✅⚪), description, owner (teal), status label, and a navy "Company" pill when `company_rock = true`.
  - **Column 2 — Weekly Numbers**: mini-table of `scorecard_metrics` × the last 6 Monday-anchored weeks. Columns are Metric · Goal · 6 week-date headers. Each cell is teal (`hit`) or red (`miss`) against the metric's goal (when goal is non-null); empty cells are grey em-dashes. Owner is shown as a teal sub-line under the metric name.
  - **Column 3 — Open Issues**: numbered list of `issues` rows where `status = 'open'`, ordered by `created_at ASC`. Each issue shows description + owner sub-line. Count of open issues appears in the heading-meta.
- **Doc header** — business name (from `activeOrg.getName()` with a fallback Supabase lookup if the cache is empty), "Operations Snapshot" subtitle, today's date.
- **Data layer** — reads `rocks`, `scorecard_metrics`, `scorecard_entries`, `issues`, all scoped by `organisation_id = activeOrg.get()`. Same RLS gate as the per-page tools. No new schema, no SQL.
- **Empty states** — "No quarterly goals recorded." / "No weekly numbers recorded yet." / "No open issues. Nice work." per column when the active business has none.
- **Print** — same `@page A4 landscape` rules + print-only stylesheet as `one-page-plan.html`, so the print button drops to a clean one-page PDF.
- **Linked from `operations.html`** via a new "View One-Page Operations" `.view-plan-btn` (matching style added inline, mirroring `strategy.html`).

---

## v0.5.113
- **Fixed cross-account data leak on `business.html`.** User opened the business dashboard for a brand-new client account and saw Coach4U's sample 1-year goal ("Sign 20 new clients, launch group coaching program, hire first associate coach by Q3, and publish Signature Program workbook") plus Coach4U's core values pills (Integrity / Growth Mindset / Client First / Accountability) — even though no `targets` or `core_values` row existed in Supabase for the new org. Looked like multi-tenant data was bleeding across accounts; actually a pre-existing display bug that only became visible once a second account existed.
- **Root cause:** the 1-Year Goal and Core Values panels had hardcoded Coach4U sample text inside the HTML (`<div id="oneYearGoal">Sign 20 new clients…</div>`, `<span class="value-pill">Integrity</span>` etc.). The render JS only overwrote those defaults IF the Supabase query returned a row. For a new biz with no row, the JS bailed out of the `if (targets)` / `if (cv)` block and the hardcoded Coach4U text just stayed visible. Same pattern as the `one-page-plan.html` issue that v0.5.104 fixed — this was the other half.
- **Fix:** replaced the hardcoded sample text with empty-state placeholders ("No 1-year goal set yet." / "No core values set yet."). Render logic now toggles the placeholder explicitly — when Supabase has data, show it (in primary navy); when it doesn't, show the placeholder (in grey). Also clears the `oneYearMeta` line when no data, instead of leaving "Target: Dec 2025 · Revenue: $420K" stale.
- **Removed 5 dead localStorage seeds** from `ensureSeeds()`: `coach4u_core_values`, `coach4u_core_focus`, `coach4u_targets`, `coach4u_marketing_strategy`, `coach4u_leadership_team`. The strategy worksheets all moved to Supabase a while back, so these keys had no readers — `ensureSeeds()` was just writing Coach4U sample data into the user's localStorage on every page load, where it sat globally (not scoped to org or account) and could confuse anyone digging into devtools. The `coach4u_demo_meetings` / `coach4u_demo_rocks` / `coach4u_demo_scorecard` seeds stay — `operations.html` still wires off `coach4u_demo_meetings` for its "Run Weekly Meeting" button, and the other two stubs feed operations tools that haven't been migrated yet.
- **No SQL changes.** This was front-end-only.

---

## v0.5.112
- **Fixed UX inconsistency in the multi-tenant flow.** Reported by user: "I put in the first business and it went back to accounts. I put in the second business and it went to the business IAS Life." The two creation paths (`+ New client account` vs. `+ New Business`) had different post-create destinations — confusing, and the dashboard isn't the right landing place after creating a business anyway. Now both flows navigate to `business.html` for the newly-created business, so the user can start filling in worksheets / scorecard / etc. immediately.
- **`create_client_account` RPC — return type widened.** Was `RETURNS uuid` (the subscription_id only). Now `RETURNS TABLE(subscription_id uuid, organisation_id uuid)` so the front-end has both ids and can `activeOrg.set(newOrgId, bizName)` before navigating into the new business. The SQL delta gained a `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.create_client_account(text, text)` before the CREATE — Postgres won't let `CREATE OR REPLACE` change a function's return type, and the user already ran the previous version, so the DROP is required for the re-run to succeed. `supabase/v0.5.111-delta.sql` was edited in-place rather than spawning a v0.5.112-delta, since the v0.5.111 RPC and v0.5.112 RPC describe the same intent — anyone setting up fresh just runs the latest delta once.
- **Front-end** (`index.html`): the modal save handler now reads `row.subscription_id` + `row.organisation_id` from the RPC result, calls `activeOrg.setSubscription(...)` and `activeOrg.set(...)` for both, and redirects to `business.html` instead of `window.location.reload()`.
- **Re-run required:** `supabase/v0.5.111-delta.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor. The DROP at the top makes it idempotent.

---

## v0.5.111
- **Multi-tenant — one user can own multiple client accounts.** User feedback: "I want to set up a test client from the top, replace SARUBA with the client's details". Built end-to-end so you (the business coach) can manage many clients from one login: each client is its own `subscriptions` row, you're the owner of each, you switch between them with a dropdown at the top of the dashboard.
- **`supabase/v0.5.111-delta.sql` — two changes:**
  - New RPC **`create_client_account(account_name, business_name)`** — always creates a new subscription (vs. `bootstrap_account_and_business` which reuses one if you have it). Also creates the first business + admin team_member row, all in one transaction.
  - **`bootstrap_organisation`** signature changed from `(business_name)` to `(business_name, subscription_id uuid DEFAULT NULL)`. If `subscription_id` is provided, validates ownership and targets that sub. If NULL, falls back to LIMIT 1 (backward compat for `setup.html`). The old single-arg function is dropped — `CREATE OR REPLACE` with the new signature would have created a separate function rather than replacing.
- **UI changes in `index.html`:**
  - New top-of-page **account switcher** — a `<select>` listing every subscription you own, plus a teal `+ New client account` button on the right. Hidden when you have only one account (still visible via the "Set up another client" UX once it's wired). Lives above the account header in its own `.acct-switcher` bar.
  - New **"Set up a new client account"** modal — two fields: client/account name + first business name. On submit calls `create_client_account` RPC, sets the new subscription as active in localStorage, reloads the dashboard.
  - **Active-subscription tracking** in `js/active-org.js`: extended to store/retrieve `coach4u_active_subscription_id` and `coach4u_active_subscription_name`. Switching account calls `setSubscription(...)` and clears the active-org cache (so a stale business name from another client doesn't bleed across).
  - **Data scoping**: the memberships query now uses Supabase's `!inner` join to filter by `organisations.subscription_id = activeSub.id`, so the dashboard only shows businesses inside the currently-selected account.
  - **Rename account** now uses a direct `UPDATE subscriptions SET name = ? WHERE id = ?` (RLS enforces ownership), scoped to the active subscription. The legacy `update_account_name` RPC updated every sub the user owned — wrong for multi-tenant.
  - **+ New Business** passes `subscription_id: sub.id` so the new business lands in the active client account, not an arbitrary one.
  - Empty-state for an account with no businesses now says "No businesses in *Acme Group* yet. Click + New Business to create one." (instead of redirecting to setup.html, which would have created a fresh subscription on top of everything else).
- **First-run guard** moved up: only redirects to `setup.html` if the user has zero subscriptions. An empty subscription (zero businesses) shows the friendly empty state instead.
- **No schema changes** — `subscriptions.owner_user_id` already supported multiple per user (the index is non-unique). RLS policies on subscriptions already allowed owner reads/inserts/updates of their own rows.
- **Next test client flow:** sign in → top switcher → **+ New client account** → enter client's account name + first business name → start populating. Repeat per client. Switch between them via the dropdown.

---

## v0.5.110
- **Added the Coach role** — admin-equivalent for data/team operations, intended to be exempt from per-seat billing when billing is wired. Use case: you (the business coach) live inside a client's account, edit alongside them, but shouldn't consume one of the client's 3 included paid seats. This was the locked-in plan from the conversation around v0.5.107 — now built end-to-end.
- **What a Coach can do:** edit every data table (worksheets, scorecard, goals, meetings, issues, planning sessions), invite/remove other team members. **What a Coach CANNOT do:** rename or delete the business itself — those stay admin-only because they're business-lifecycle actions tied to the subscription owner.
- **Schema delta — `supabase/v0.5.110-delta.sql` (paste-and-run in Supabase SQL Editor):**
  - `ALTER team_members` CHECK constraint to allow `role IN ('admin', 'coach', 'member')` (was `'admin','member'`)
  - `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION user_admin_org_ids(uid)` to return orgs where role is `admin` OR `coach` — this single change cascades through every data-table RLS policy that uses the helper, granting coaches admin-write access without per-table edits
  - `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION invite_team_member()` — accepts `'coach'` in the role validation; the admin-check now allows admin OR coach to invite
  - `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION remove_team_member()` — same admin-or-coach allowance; the "don't remove the last admin" guard still only counts admins (coaches don't satisfy the admin requirement for that org)
  - `rename_business()` and `delete_business()` are LEFT untouched — those check role='admin' directly (not via the helper), so they remain admin-only as designed
- **`schema.sql`** updated in lockstep so future fresh deployments have the right shape from the start.
- **UI in `index.html`:**
  - Invite modal: third option "Coach — admin rights, not billed as a user" with help text below explaining when to use it ("for service providers who edit alongside the team but shouldn't consume a paid seat")
  - New `.role-coach` pill style — purple (`#ede9fe` bg, `#6d28d9` text) for clear visual distinction from the blue Admin pill and grey Member pill
  - Two `myMemberships.filter(m => m.role === 'admin')` call sites updated to include `'coach'` so coaches see the team list across all their orgs and the invite-business picker shows orgs they coach for
  - The per-business `⋮` actions menu (Rename / Delete) is gated to `role === 'admin'` only — coaches don't see it, matching the SQL gating
- **No client-side billing logic changes** because billing isn't wired up yet. When it lands (subscription seat count), the rule will be: count team_members where `status='active' AND role != 'coach'` for the seat tally.

---

## v0.5.109
- **Extended the team-member dropdown to the other 3 free-text owner fields** — completes the v0.5.108 pattern. Now consistent across every owner field in the app: every "who's responsible?" picker is a select populated from the active org's `team_members`, so reports can `GROUP BY owner` reliably.
- **Files migrated (3):**
  - `scorecard.html` — `metric-owner` in the Add/Edit Metric modal (was `<input type="text" placeholder="Name">`)
  - `issues.html` — `issue-owner` in the Add/Edit Issue modal (was `<input type="text" placeholder="Who raised this?">`)
  - `run-meeting.html` — `todo-owner` in the inline "Add a to-do" row at the bottom of the To-Dos list (was `<input type="text" placeholder="Owner" style="max-width:120px;">`). This one's special because the input is rendered inside a template string per call to `renderTodos()`, so it uses an `ownerSelectHtml(id, currentValue)` builder helper rather than the imperative `renderOwnerSelect(currentValue)` pattern used by the modals.
- **Same loader + fallback pattern** as v0.5.108: `loadOwnerOptions()` queries `team_members WHERE organisation_id = orgId AND status != 'removed'`, builds a deduped sorted list (preferring `display_name`, falling back to `invited_email`). When editing an existing row whose owner doesn't match a current team member, the option "Name (not on team)" is appended so legacy values aren't lost.
- **No schema changes.** Values still stored as text in `scorecard_metrics.owner`, `issues.owner`, `meeting_todos.owner`. RLS untouched.
- **Architectural detail:** for `run-meeting.html`, the IIFE needed careful re-closing (`})()`) and the helpers were added at module-scope after the IIFE. `OWNER_NAMES` and `loadOwnerOptions` / `ownerSelectHtml` are accessible from `renderTodos` because the IIFE pauses at its first `await`, letting the script's top-level continue executing past the IIFE call before `renderTodos` is ever invoked.

---

## v0.5.108
- **Quarterly Goals owner field is now a dropdown of the active org's team members** instead of a free-text input. User feedback: with the old text field, typos like "cath" vs "Cath" prevented reliable per-user reporting — "show me all of Cath's goals" wouldn't work because the values were inconsistent.
- **How it works:**
  - On page load, `loadOwnerOptions()` queries `team_members` for the active org (excluding `status='removed'`) and builds a deduped, sorted list of names — using `display_name` first, falling back to `invited_email` if no display name has been set.
  - The Add / Edit Goal modal's Owner field renders as `<select>` with "— Unassigned —" + each team member name.
  - When editing a rock whose `owner` is a legacy free-text value (e.g. a name that's no longer on the team), the select appends a one-off option labelled "Name (not on team)" so the original value isn't lost.
- **No schema change** — the saved value is still text in `rocks.owner`. The change is purely UI-side. Reports against canonical owner names (`GROUP BY owner`) now produce correct counts because the strings are constrained to the team list.
- **Same pattern can be applied later** to `scorecard_metrics.owner`, `meeting_todos.owner`, `issues.owner` — they're all free-text today. Doing them in a follow-up if requested.

---

## v0.5.107
- **Bug fix: every "Send invite" click failed with `column reference "role" is ambiguous`.** The `invite_team_member(business_id, email, role, display_name)` RPC has a parameter named `role`, and the `team_members` table has a `role` column. The admin-check inside the function used the unqualified `role` reference, which Postgres flagged as ambiguous and refused to run.
- **Fix:** qualified every column reference inside the function as `team_members.role` / `team_members.organisation_id` / `team_members.user_id` / `team_members.status` / `team_members.invited_email`, plus `auth.users.email` in the user-lookup query. The function signature and behaviour are unchanged.
- **Requires SQL:** see `supabase/v0.5.107-delta.sql` — paste the entire file into the Supabase SQL Editor and run once. The `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` replaces the function in place. No data migration.
- **Verified the fix matches `schema.sql`** — both are now in sync, so any future fresh deployment of the schema will already be correct.

---

## v0.5.106
- **Mobile responsive fixes for the standardized navy header (v0.5.105).** With "Your Business Coach" + back-link + biz-pill + Sign Out all in the same bar, the worst-case width at ~390px (iPhone) added up to ~415px — overflow / wrap territory. Audited the 22 navy-header pages: none of them have inline header CSS, so the fix is purely in `css/style.css`.
- **Changes in `css/style.css`:**
  - `@media (max-width: 640px)` — tightened `.header-inner` gap from 16px → 8px, `.header-left` gap from 16px → 10px with `min-width: 0; flex: 1 1 auto` so it can shrink. `.header-title` dropped from 17px → 16px with `white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis` so it truncates instead of overflowing. `.header-back` and `.sign-out-btn` get `flex-shrink: 0; white-space: nowrap` so they stay intact. Sign Out padding shrunk 5px 10px → 5px 9px and font 13px → 12px.
  - `@media (max-width: 480px)` — `.header-title` to 14px. `.biz-pill` font 11px → 10px, padding 3px 8px → 3px 7px, max-width 140px → 110px.
  - `@media (max-width: 400px)` — new breakpoint just for tight phones. `.header-left` gap → 8px, `.header-title` → 13px, `.biz-pill` max-width → 90px, `.header-back` → 12px.
- **Bottom-nav** (5 items: Home / Planning / Strategy / Operations / Learn) was already handled — each `.bottom-nav-item` uses `flex: 1`, so 5 even slots fit on any phone width down to ~320px.
- **No per-page HTML changes** — all 22 navy-header pages share `css/style.css`, so the single CSS update fixes them all.

---

## v0.5.105
- **Every navy site-header now says "Your Business Coach"** instead of the page-specific name. User feedback: with the same navy bar showing different titles per page (Planning, Strategy, Core Values, etc.), there was no consistent brand anchor. The page-specific name was also redundant with the body subheading (`<h1 class="ws-title">🗺️ Planning</h1>` etc.) right below it.
- **The header now reads identically on every business-level and account-level hub/worksheet page:** `← Back · Your Business Coach · [🏢 Active Business pill]`. Context comes from the back-link target (Home / Account / Strategy / etc.) and the body's page-intro `<h1>` (which already exists on every page — `core-values.html`'s "⭐ Core Values", `planning.html`'s "🗺️ Planning", `scorecard.html`'s "📊 Weekly Numbers", etc.).
- **Files updated (22):** `business.html`, `index.html`, `account-strategy.html`, `account-planning.html`, `account-operations.html`, `strategy.html`, `planning.html`, `operations.html`, `learning-vault.html`, `core-values.html`, `core-focus.html`, `targets.html`, `marketing-strategy.html`, `leadership-team.html`, `scorecard.html`, `goals.html`, `meeting.html`, `run-meeting.html`, `issues.html`, `annual-sessions.html`, `quarterly-sessions.html`, `run-annual-session.html`, `run-quarterly-session.html`, `team-checkin.html`.
- **One ordered sed pass:** `s|<span class="header-title">[^<]*</span>|<span class="header-title">Your Business Coach</span>|g` across all root HTML files. The biz-pill (`#activeBizName`) markup that v0.5.98 added is unaffected — it still sits right after the header-title and renders `🏢 [Business Name]` on business-level pages.
- **Not touched:** account-level carousel leaf pages (`account-plans`, `account-values`, etc.) use a separate white `.screen-toolbar` pattern (toolbar-back + toolbar-title), not the navy `site-header`. Their toolbar titles are page-specific by design ("One-Page Plans — All Businesses" etc.) and weren't part of the user's "dark blue area" feedback. Same for `404.html`, `offline.html`, `inactive.html`, `forgot-password.html`, `reset-password.html`, `login.html` (no header) and `setup.html`.

---

## v0.5.104
- **Stripped hardcoded sample text from `one-page-plan.html`.** This was the root cause of the user-reported "the previous dummy data is still appearing". The page's body had Coach4U-flavoured sample text baked into the HTML (Integrity / Growth mindset / Client first / Accountability pills; "To help business owners build thriving…" purpose; "$1.2M" 3-year revenue; etc.). The v0.5.99 migration swapped the data source from localStorage to Supabase but kept the render helpers as overlays — `setText` / `renderValuesPills` / `renderNumList` only OVERWROTE the DOM when the field had a value, so when the Supabase row was empty (e.g. a fresh business), the hardcoded fallback stayed visible. Looked like the data had migrated; was actually static markup.
- **Cleared every `opp-*` element to empty / `&mdash;`** so the doc starts with no fake content baked in. Including the doc-header `Your Business Name` → bound to active-org name; doc-year `2025 – 2035` → `currentYear – currentYear+10`.
- **Helpers updated to always render with placeholders:**
  - `setText(id, value, placeholder)` now always touches the DOM. Empty value → renders the placeholder (default `—`) with a `.empty` class for muted-italic styling.
  - `renderNumList(id, raw, emptyLabel)` renders a single muted `<li>` with the empty label when no items.
  - `renderValuesPills(data)` adds an `.empty-pills` class and "No core values recorded yet." text when no values.
- **CSS additions:** `.field-value.empty` / `.fin-cell .field-value.empty` / `.num-list.empty-list` / `.values-pills.empty-pills` — all muted grey italic.
- **Org name fetch:** init reads `window.activeOrg.getName()` first. If the cache is empty (e.g. user bookmarked the URL), it adds a 6th parallel query to `organisations` for the name as a fallback so the doc-header always populates.
- **No behaviour change** when the Supabase row IS filled — those values still render the same way.

---

## v0.5.103
- **Removed the stale "data-layer migration pending" banner from all 13 account-level carousel pages.** The yellow `data-banner` was introduced in v0.5.91 / v0.5.96 when the cross-business carousel pages shipped before the worksheet pages were wired to Supabase. After the v0.5.99–v0.5.102 migration the banner became wrong: it kept firing whenever every business returned empty data, but that's no longer "data layer pending" — it's just "no one's filled in this worksheet yet", which the per-card empty-state placeholders (e.g. "No core values recorded yet") already communicate clearly.
- **Mechanics:** stripped the `<div id="dataBanner">…</div>` markup AND the `if (!anyData) document.getElementById('dataBanner').style.display = 'block'` JS toggle from each of the 13 carousel pages: `account-plans`, `account-values`, `account-focus`, `account-targets`, `account-marketing`, `account-leadership`, `account-annual`, `account-quarterly`, `account-checkins`, `account-numbers`, `account-goals`, `account-meetings`, `account-issues`. The `.data-banner` CSS class definitions are left in place as harmless dead code.
- **No other functional changes.** Carousels still work end-to-end; empty cards still show "— not recorded —" / "No X recorded yet" inline; the share-link experience is unchanged.

---

## v0.5.102
- **`team-checkin.html` wired to Supabase — login required.** The deferred item from v0.5.101 is now done. The form is no longer anonymous; respondents sign in with their Supabase account, which lets the page validate them via RLS and stamp `team_checkins.user_id` properly. Matches the "team-scoped, role-based" architecture documented in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **New flow:**
  1. Recipient clicks the share link `team-checkin.html?session={uuid}&type=annual|quarterly`.
  2. Page validates the URL params. Missing / malformed → "Invalid check-in link" message.
  3. `supabase.auth.getUser()` — if no session, redirects to `login.html?returnTo=<current URL>`. After successful sign-in, `login.html` redirects back to the check-in.
  4. Fetches the session from `annual_sessions` or `quarterly_sessions` (single query). RLS naturally enforces membership — if the signed-in user isn't a member of the owning org, the query returns nothing → "You don't have access to this check-in" with a "Sign in as a different user" link.
  5. Queries `team_members` for `display_name` + active membership confirmation.
  6. Checks `team_checkins` for an existing submission by this user for this session. If found → "Already submitted on {date}" — resubmission blocked for MVP.
  7. Otherwise renders the 17-question form with the name field pre-filled from `team_members.display_name` (falling back to the user's email prefix).
  8. On submit → `INSERT INTO team_checkins` with `organisation_id`, `session_id`, `session_type`, `user_id = auth.uid()`, `name`, `role`, `scores` (17-int array), `comments` (17-string array). RLS policy "members insert own team_checkin" handles the WITH CHECK.
- **`login.html` gains `?returnTo=` support.** Reads the param, validates it's same-origin via the URL constructor, and redirects there instead of `index.html` after sign-in (or pre-resolves the session check at page load). Falls back to `index.html` if the param is missing or unsafe.
- **No SQL changes.** The RLS policies for `team_checkins` (`members read team_checkins`, `members insert own team_checkin`, `admins update/delete team_checkins`) were already in the original schema — they just didn't get exercised because the form was localStorage-only.
- **URL shape unchanged.** The share link generated by `run-annual-session.html` / `run-quarterly-session.html` (uuid-based since v0.5.101) keeps working — the page now expects string ids instead of `parseInt`'d numerics.
- **Workspace results light up automatically.** Now that team members write to `team_checkins`, the aggregated read in `run-annual-session.html` / `run-quarterly-session.html` (and the cross-business `account-checkins.html` carousel) shows real responses instead of "No responses yet".
- **Header now includes a "Sign Out" button** so a user who's signed in as the wrong account can swap users without leaving the page.
- **localStorage stub removed.** The old `coach4u_team_checkins` localStorage key is no longer written to. Any existing values are ignored (fresh-data approach, same as the other batches).
- **Data-layer migration complete.** All five batches are now live: Strategy (v0.5.99) → Operations (v0.5.100) → Planning admin (v0.5.101) → Team check-ins (v0.5.102). Every business-level page is on Supabase, scoped by `coach4u_active_org_id` or by URL param + RLS validation.

---

## v0.5.101
- **Planning batch wired to Supabase.** The 4 planning admin pages (`annual-sessions.html`, `run-annual-session.html`, `quarterly-sessions.html`, `run-quarterly-session.html`) are no longer backed by `localStorage` — they now read and write directly to the `annual_sessions` / `quarterly_sessions` / `team_checkins` Supabase tables, scoped by the active organisation. This is the third slice of the data-layer migration (strategy batch in v0.5.99, operations batch in v0.5.100).
- **Fresh-data approach — no localStorage migration.** Consistent with the locked plan, this migration does NOT copy old `coach4u_annual_sessions` / `coach4u_quarterly_sessions` / `coach4u_team_checkins` values into Supabase. New businesses see no sessions until they create one via the "+ New Annual/Quarterly Session" button. The legacy localStorage keys are left in place but unread.
- **The 4 admin pages migrated:**
  - `annual-sessions.html` → `SELECT * FROM annual_sessions WHERE organisation_id = orgId ORDER BY session_date DESC`. The "+ New Annual Session" button INSERTs a new row (today's date, current year, status `scheduled`, empty `attendance`, empty `areas_completed` jsonb) and redirects to `run-annual-session.html?id={uuid}`. Session ids are uuids returned by Postgres `gen_random_uuid()` — the prior `Date.now()*1000+random` numeric id scheme is gone.
  - `run-annual-session.html` → loads a single session by uuid (`.maybeSingle()`) plus its team check-ins (`SELECT * FROM team_checkins WHERE session_id = id AND session_type = 'annual'`). Attendance textarea: 300ms-debounced `UPDATE annual_sessions SET attendance = ? WHERE id = ?`. Area checklist (4 areas): on toggle, full `areas_completed` jsonb is recomputed and immediately upserted; UI state is rolled back on save error. Status dropdown and timer Start/Stop also UPDATE the row. Aggregated check-in results (count, per-question avg with red/amber/green dots, expandable comments) preserved 1:1 — only the data source swapped.
  - `quarterly-sessions.html` → same shape as annual-sessions but for `quarterly_sessions`. "+ New Quarterly Session" opens the existing modal (target quarter + date pickers), INSERTs with the chosen values + `target_quarter`, then redirects. The next-upcoming-quarter helper and `quarterEndDate` math kept as-is.
  - `run-quarterly-session.html` → same shape as run-annual-session but for `quarterly_sessions` with 3 areas instead of 4. Sets the active-session pill label to `(target_quarter || 'Quarterly') + ' Session'` on Start.
- **Per-page behaviour:**
  - **No-active-org guard** — every planning page calls `window.activeOrg.get()` after auth + membership check. No active org → `window.location.href = 'index.html'`.
  - **Workspace pages also guard on `?id=`** — `run-annual-session.html` with no id redirects to `annual-sessions.html`; `run-quarterly-session.html` with no id redirects to `quarterly-sessions.html`. Previously they showed an inline "no session selected" empty state; the redirect is cleaner and matches `run-meeting.html` (migrated in v0.5.100).
  - **Invalid session id** — if `?id={uuid}` doesn't match a row, the workspace shows a friendly "Session not found" message with a back-link to the list page. No crash.
  - **Load on init** — `Promise.all`-style parallel loads (session row + team_checkins) where applicable. Body opacity stays at 0 until the load resolves; set to 1 on success or error so a Supabase failure doesn't trap the user behind a blank page.
  - **Save on edit** — debounce on attendance (300ms), immediate on area checkbox toggle, status dropdown, timer transitions, INSERTs from "+ New Session" buttons.
  - **RLS reality** — admins write, members read. Member writes will hit RLS denial and be logged via `console.warn` + toast. Read-only mode deferred.
- **SEED removal.** The old `_annualSeed()` / `_quarterlySeed()` constants + `_annualLoad()` / `_quarterlySave()` localStorage helpers are deleted from the 4 admin pages. A short JS block comment at the top of each script preserves the previous sample-data shape for future reference. The numeric id scheme (`5001`, `5002`, `6001`, `6002`, `6003`) is gone — uuids only.
- **`coach4u_active_planning_session` localStorage key kept alive.** The floating "Resume Planning Session" pill (rendered by `js/active-session.js` on every main page) still uses this localStorage key to know which session to link back to. Workspace pages continue to call `window.activeSession.set('annual', sessionId, label)` on Start and `window.activeSession.clear()` on Complete. This is a UI hint, not the data of record — the actual session row lives in Supabase.
- **`js/active-session.js` fix.** Previously the pill's `isStillActive()` check read `coach4u_annual_sessions` / `coach4u_quarterly_sessions` localStorage to verify the underlying session was still in progress. With those keys no longer populated, the check would always fail and the pill would self-clear immediately after being set. Simplified `isStillActive()` to trust the pill's own record — the workspace pages call `window.activeSession.clear()` explicitly on completion / timer-stop, which is the correct source of truth for the pill's lifecycle.
- **`team-checkin.html` deferred.** The public, anonymous team check-in form is intentionally left unchanged in this version. Migrating it requires a separate design decision on how to handle anonymous INSERTs into `team_checkins`:
  - **(A)** Loosen RLS to allow anon INSERT after validating the session exists (needs an `EXISTS` clause referencing `annual_sessions` / `quarterly_sessions`).
  - **(B)** A SECURITY DEFINER RPC for anonymous submissions.
  - **(C)** Switch to the "team members must log in" model from the planned architecture (changes UX — no longer truly anonymous).
  - Until that decision lands, `team-checkin.html` still writes to `localStorage` (`coach4u_team_checkins`). The workspace pages now query the Supabase `team_checkins` table for the results display — so until `team-checkin.html` is migrated, the aggregated results section will show "No responses yet" for any new session. Existing localStorage check-ins are no longer surfaced (intentional: fresh-data approach).
- **Visual / UX unchanged.** Existing DOM IDs preserved (`session-status`, `attendance-input`, `areas-progress`, `ci-results`, `ci-comments-toggle`, `timer-btn`, `timer-elapsed`, `new-session-btn`, `new-session-modal`, etc.). Toast notifications still fire for save/update success and failure. The site-header / bottom-nav / `#activeBizName` business pill / Resume Planning Session pill — all unchanged. No frameworks added.
- **Account-level carousel pages light up automatically.** `account-annual.html`, `account-quarterly.html`, and `account-checkins.html` (added in v0.5.96 to aggregate planning data across all businesses) have been waiting for real writes — they now stop showing "data-layer-pending" as soon as any business creates a session.
- **Next:** the `team-checkin.html` migration is the last localStorage holdout for the planning subsystem. Once that lands (along with the design decision on anonymous-submit), the legacy `coach4u_*` localStorage keys can be retired entirely and `ensureSeeds()` in `business.html` removed.

---

## v0.5.100
- **Operations batch wired to Supabase.** The 4 operations tools (`scorecard.html`, `goals.html`, `meeting.html` + `run-meeting.html`, `issues.html`) are no longer backed by `localStorage` — they now read and write directly to the corresponding Supabase tables, scoped by the active organisation. This is the second slice of the data-layer migration (strategy batch shipped in v0.5.99).
- **Fresh-data approach — no localStorage migration.** Per the locked plan, this migration does NOT copy old `coach4u_demo_*` localStorage values into Supabase. New businesses see empty tools and fill them in fresh. The old localStorage keys are left in place untouched (the `ensureSeeds()` block in `business.html` still seeds them for legacy reasons, but the dashboard panels no longer read from them — they query Supabase instead).
- **The 5 operations pages migrated:**
  - `scorecard.html` → 2-table CRUD on `scorecard_metrics` + `scorecard_entries`. Loads metrics ordered by `sort_order`, then loads all entries for the visible 6-week window via `.in('metric_id', [...]).gte('week_date', oldest)`. Cell save uses `upsert({ metric_id, week_date, value }, { onConflict: 'metric_id,week_date' })`. Clearing a cell DELETEs by composite key. Metric add/edit/delete uses INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE; child entries are CASCADE-deleted via the FK. **Schema note:** the page's "measurement type" dropdown now uses the canonical `count|currency|percentage|score` values from the `scorecard_metrics.measurement_type` CHECK constraint (the old localStorage stub used `'number'` — switched to `'count'` to match the DB).
  - `goals.html` → CRUD on `rocks` filtered by `quarter = currentQuarter()`. Computes the current quarter in JS as `'Q' + (Math.floor(d.getMonth() / 3) + 1) + ' ' + d.getFullYear()`. Quarter dropdown now built dynamically (5-quarter window: previous, current, next 3) instead of being hardcoded to Q1–Q4 2026 + Q1 2027. Status options exposed in the modal include `not_started` to match the DB CHECK constraint. `company_rock` is now a real boolean (DB column type) rather than the old 0/1 integer; UI behavior unchanged. Add inserts with `sort_order = max + 1`; edit and delete by id.
  - `meeting.html` → list of meetings ordered by `meeting_date DESC`. "+ New Meeting" INSERTs into `meetings` with `status='scheduled'` and the user-chosen date + quarter, then redirects to `run-meeting.html?id={uuid}`. Quarter dropdown also built dynamically.
  - `run-meeting.html` → loads the meeting + its `meeting_headlines` + `meeting_todos` via `Promise.all`. CRUD on each child table is via INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE keyed by `id`. Status change (Scheduled / In Progress / Completed) updates `meetings.status`. The "Start Meeting" timer transitions status to `in_progress` on start and `completed` on stop. Rating buttons UPDATE `meetings.rating`. Notes "Save Notes" button UPDATEs `meetings.notes`. **Edge case noted:** the existing page used URL param `?id={numeric}`; we now use `?id={uuid}` — the page reads the raw string param and passes it through to Supabase queries unchanged. If no `id` is in the URL, `run-meeting.html` redirects to `meeting.html` (was: showed an empty-state message).
  - `issues.html` → CRUD on `issues` ordered by `created_at DESC`. The kanban Open/Resolved split is computed client-side from the result set. Owner filter is a client-side filter against the in-memory `_issues` list (was: refetched). Mark-as-resolved requires a solution per existing UX. Add inserts, edit updates, delete deletes by id.
- **Per-page behaviour:**
  - **No-active-org guard** — every operations page calls `window.activeOrg.get()` after auth + membership check. No active org → `window.location.href = 'index.html'`. `run-meeting.html` adds a second guard: no `?id=` URL param → `window.location.href = 'meeting.html'`.
  - **Load on init** — Single Supabase query per table scoped by `organisation_id` (or by parent foreign key for child tables). Use `Promise.all` for parallel loads where a page needs both parent + children (run-meeting + business.html dashboard).
  - **Save on edit** — Immediate save for buttons / checkboxes / Add / Delete. Modal-driven edits (goals, issues, metrics) save on the modal's Save button click. Cell edits in scorecard upsert immediately. Save errors are caught with `console.warn` and surfaced via toast — they don't crash the page.
  - **RLS reality** — admins write, members read. Member writes will hit RLS denial and be logged silently. Read-only mode is deferred until a later release.
- **`business.html` dashboard panels migrated.** The 3 panels and 2 stat tiles that previously read `coach4u_demo_*` localStorage now query Supabase:
  - **"Open Issues" stat tile** → `supabase.from('issues').select('id', { count: 'exact', head: true }).eq('organisation_id', orgId).eq('status', 'open')`.
  - **"Goals On Track" stat tile** → count of current-quarter rocks with status `on_track` or `done` over the total. Quarter computed from JS clock; no fallback-to-all-rocks hack (the old localStorage version had one because the seed quarter was hardcoded as Q2 2026 — no longer needed with real per-business data).
  - **"This Week" panel** → most recent meeting's open todos (`meeting_todos` where `done=false`, ordered by `created_at`, limited to 4). The "focus meeting" is the same one used for the "Next Meeting" tile and the meeting button link (this-week's Monday meeting, else next upcoming, else most recent). When no meeting exists the panel keeps its default "No todos for this week yet" copy.
  - **"This Quarter" panel** → rocks for the current quarter from Supabase, rendered with the same status-pill colors as before (`pill-green / pill-amber / pill-red / pill-grey`). Progress bar shows `on_track` count / total.
  - **"1-Year Goal" + "Core Values" panels** were already on Supabase as of v0.5.99 — left as-is; verified they still work after this pass.
  - `renderDashboard()` is now `async`, takes `orgId` as a param, runs 5 parallel queries via `Promise.all`, then a 6th query for todos once the focus meeting is known. Errors are logged via `console.warn`; partial failures don't trap the user behind a blank page.
- **`ensureSeeds()` left in place but unread.** The block that seeds the old `coach4u_demo_*` keys is still called on first visit. Reading from those keys for the dashboard panels is gone — they're now live Supabase queries. The seeds are harmless; they'll be removed in a future cleanup pass once we're sure no other page depends on them.
- **SEED removal in each tool.** Each operations page's old `_*Seed()` constant + `_*Load()` + `api()` function block (the localStorage demo stub from v0.5.50) has been deleted entirely. A short JS block comment at the top of each script preserves the previous sample data values for future reference. The `_LS_KEY` constants are gone. The `currentBusinessId = 1` hardcoded value is gone — now uses real `orgId` from `window.activeOrg.get()`.
- **Visual / UX unchanged.** Existing DOM field IDs preserved (cell-popover, metric-modal, goal-modal, issue-modal, agenda accordion, rating buttons, etc.). Toast notifications still fire for save success / failure. The site-header, bottom-nav, `#activeBizName` business pill — all unchanged. No frameworks added; each page remains a self-contained vanilla ES module with its own Supabase client init.
- **Account-level carousel pages light up automatically.** `account-numbers.html`, `account-goals.html`, `account-meetings.html`, and `account-issues.html` (added in earlier versions to aggregate operations data across all businesses) have been waiting for real writes — they now stop showing "data-layer-pending" as soon as any business uses a tool.
- **Next: v0.5.101+** continues the migration with the planning session workspaces (`annual-sessions.html` / `run-annual-session.html` / `quarterly-sessions.html` / `run-quarterly-session.html`) and the team check-in flow (`team-checkin.html` results aggregation). After that, the localStorage layer can be retired entirely and `ensureSeeds()` removed.

---

## v0.5.99
- **Strategy batch wired to Supabase.** The 5 strategy worksheets and the one-pager reader are no longer backed by `localStorage` — they read and write directly to Supabase, scoped by the active organisation. This is the first slice of the data-layer migration teed up in v0.5.97 / v0.5.98.
- **Fresh-data approach — no localStorage migration.** Per the locked plan, the migration does **not** copy old `coach4u_*` localStorage values into Supabase. New businesses see empty inputs and fill them in fresh. The old localStorage keys are left in place untouched (and the dashboard panels in `business.html` still seed them for sample-data display until that page is migrated separately).
- **The 6 files migrated:**
  - `core-values.html` → single-row upsert on `core_values` (PK `organisation_id`; 8 value columns). `value_1`..`value_8` map directly to the existing input `data-key` attributes.
  - `core-focus.html` → single-row upsert on `core_focus` (PK `organisation_id`; `purpose`, `niche`).
  - `targets.html` → single-row upsert on `targets` (PK `organisation_id`; 9 columns covering 10-year vision + 3-year picture + 1-year plan).
  - `marketing-strategy.html` → single-row upsert on `marketing_strategy` (PK `organisation_id`; `target_market`, `uniques`, `proven_process`, `guarantee`).
  - `leadership-team.html` → multi-row CRUD on `leadership_team_members` (uuid id, `name`, `role`, `responsibilities`, `placeholder`, `sort_order`). INSERT on Add Team Member, DELETE on the per-card trash icon, debounced UPDATE-by-id on field edits.
  - `one-page-plan.html` → READ-ONLY. Replaced the 5 localStorage reads with a single `Promise.all` of 5 Supabase queries (4 `.maybeSingle()` for the org-keyed tables + 1 `.order('sort_order')` for the team). DOM field IDs (`opp-*`) and rendering helpers (`setText` / `renderNumList` / `renderValuesPills` / `renderTeamTable`) are unchanged — only the data source swapped.
- **Per-page behaviour:**
  - **No-active-org guard** — after the auth/membership check, each page calls `window.activeOrg.get()`. No active org → `window.location.href = 'index.html'`. Bookmark-direct-to-worksheet without first picking a business now redirects cleanly to the account dashboard.
  - **Load on init** — `SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE organisation_id = orgId` with `.maybeSingle()` for the 1-row tables, `.order('sort_order')` for `leadership_team_members`. Body opacity stays at 0 until the load resolves; on success or error it's set to 1 (so a load error doesn't trap the user behind a blank page).
  - **Save on edit** — 300ms debounce on text inputs and textareas, immediate save on Add / Delete. The save sends the full local state via `upsert({ organisation_id, ...data }, { onConflict: 'organisation_id' })` for the 1-row tables. Failures are caught with `console.warn` and don't crash the page — the user can keep typing and the next save attempt may succeed.
  - **RLS reality** — admins write, members read. If a member tries to type in a worksheet the upsert will return an RLS denial; we log it silently and leave the local state in place. Building a proper read-only mode is deferred until later.
- **SEED removal.** Each worksheet's old `SEED = { … }` constant + `loadData()` merge-missing-keys helper has been removed. The old sample-data values are preserved as a JS block comment at the top of the script for future reference. The `STORAGE_KEY` constants are gone too.
- **Leadership team UX preserved 1:1.** Existing card-with-edit-toggle UI, Add button at top, per-card edit + delete icons, "Save Leadership Team" footer button — all unchanged visually. Under the hood: every keystroke in the edit form schedules a debounced `UPDATE` keyed by row `id`; Add inserts a new row (with `sort_order = max + 1`) and returns the generated uuid; Delete removes by id. Pending debounce timers are flushed when the user exits edit mode or clicks Save, and cancelled when a row is deleted. The `placeholder` column is honored: the one-pager view filters placeholder rows out (matching the previous localStorage behaviour); the editable list still shows them so users can promote them once filled in.
- **Account-level carousel pages light up automatically.** `account-values.html`, `account-focus.html`, `account-targets.html`, `account-marketing.html`, `account-leadership.html`, and `account-plans.html` already read from the same 5 Supabase tables (added in v0.5.96). They've been waiting for real writes; now that the worksheets write, those pages stop showing "data-layer-pending" as soon as any business fills in any field.
- **No visual or UX changes elsewhere.** Existing DOM `data-key` and `opp-*` IDs untouched. `autoGrow` textarea behaviour preserved. `body { opacity: 0 }` initial-load pattern preserved. The site-header / bottom-nav / `#activeBizName` business-pill all unchanged. No frameworks added; each page stays a self-contained vanilla ES module with its own Supabase client init.
- **Next: v0.5.100+** continues the migration on the operations tools (`scorecard.html`, `goals.html`, `meeting.html` + `run-meeting.html`, `issues.html`) and the planning session workspaces. `business.html` dashboard panels stay on the localStorage seeds until those datasets land in Supabase too.

---

## v0.5.98
- **Every business-level page now shows a `🏢 [Business Name]` pill in its header.** Before this, all business-level pages (`strategy.html`, `core-values.html`, `scorecard.html`, etc.) looked structurally identical to their account-level counterparts (`account-strategy.html`, etc.) — same site-header, same navy bar, just a different page title. With multiple businesses under one account, the user couldn't tell at a glance which business they were currently editing. Now the business name is unmissable.
- **Visual:** small teal pill (`.biz-pill`) with 🏢 prefix, placed right after the `header-title` span in the site-header. Stands out clearly against the navy background. Empty state collapses to `display: none` so account-level pages (which don't include the pill markup) are unaffected. Mobile shrinks the pill to fit narrow screens.
- **State management:** `js/active-org.js` extended to track both the org ID and the org name in localStorage (`coach4u_active_org_id` + `coach4u_active_org_name`). The set/clear methods always update both in sync. New `renderHeader()` method finds `#activeBizName` and populates it; auto-runs on DOMContentLoaded.
- **Wiring:**
  - `index.html` (account dashboard): when a business card's "Open" button is clicked, calls `set(orgId, orgName)` instead of just `set(orgId)`. Also caches the first membership's name when no active org is set.
  - `business.html`: when it resolves the active org from memberships, calls `set(activeId, name)` so the cache is always fresh before navigation to child pages.
  - 19 other business-level pages: just need the `<span id="activeBizName" class="biz-pill"></span>` markup in their header + the `<script src="js/active-org.js" defer></script>` tag — both added via two sed passes. `one-page-plan.html` uses a sticky toolbar instead of `site-header`, so its pill goes after `.toolbar-title`.
- **Not added to** account-level pages (`index.html`, `account-strategy.html`, etc.) — they're already distinct via their "Account" header and "Across All Businesses" page intros.
- **Edge case:** if a user bookmarks a business-level page URL directly and lands without first going through the dashboard, the name might not be cached yet → pill is empty → `display: none` hides it gracefully. The normal flow (login → account dashboard → click Open → business pages) always primes the cache.

---

## v0.5.97
- **Cleanup pass before the data-layer migration.** Two changes shipped here.
- **(1) File rename — account dashboard is now the root `index.html`.**
  - `my-businesses.html` (account dashboard, post-login landing) → `index.html`
  - Former `index.html` (single-business dashboard) → `business.html`
  - Why: visiting the root URL was loading the business dashboard, which only made sense if you had a single active business already selected. The account dashboard is the true "home" — it shows every business, the stats, the team. Root URL now serves the account dashboard.
  - Update mechanics: two ordered `sed` passes across all HTML files. First pass replaced `index.html` URLs → `business.html` (in `href=`, `'…'`, `"…"` contexts). Second pass replaced `my-businesses.html` URLs → `index.html`. 38 HTML files modified; no broken references left after grep verification.
  - `setup.html` line 70 redirect (when a user with existing memberships hits the wizard) now goes to `index.html` (account picker) instead of `business.html` (specific biz), since multi-business users with no stale active org should land on the picker.
  - `business.html` already had the right guards: no memberships → setup, multi-biz + stale active org → `index.html`, single biz → use it.
  - GitHub Pages serves `/` from `index.html`, so the root URL `https://cathcoach4u.github.io/yourbusinesscoach/` now opens the SARUBA account dashboard directly.
- **(2) Dead CSS removed from the account dashboard.**
  - Stripped `.topic-section`, `.topic-section-title`, `.topic-grid`, `.topic-card`, `.tc-icon`, `.tc-name`, `.topic-card.available:hover`, `.topic-card.coming-soon`, `.coming-soon-pill`, `.available-pill` — all leftover from the v0.5.89 topic launcher that v0.5.95 removed.
  - Also stripped the placeholder comment that said "Hub navigation lives in the bottom-nav" — the bottom-nav speaks for itself.
- **Version label** moved to `business.html` footer (it travelled with the renamed file). CLAUDE.md's version-bump checklist updated to point to `business.html` instead of `index.html`.
- **Next: v0.5.98+** starts wiring the business-level worksheet pages to write to Supabase (fresh-data approach — no localStorage migration). Strategy batch first (5 worksheets + one-page-plan reader).

---

## v0.5.96
- **Built all 12 cross-business carousel leaf pages.** Every card on the 3 account-level hub pages (`account-strategy.html`, `account-planning.html`, `account-operations.html`) now opens to a real navigable page. Same carousel chrome as `account-plans.html`: sticky toolbar with "← Account" back-link + page title + Print/PDF button, page intro, optional yellow data-banner, prev/next buttons hinting the neighbour business name, centre showing current business name + "Business X of Y" + dot indicators, keyboard ArrowLeft / ArrowRight nav, print-current-view via `@media print` hiding everything except the active card. Each page is a leaf page (no bottom-nav), mirroring `one-page-plan.html` at the business level.
- **Strategy ×5:**
  - `account-values.html` — reads `core_values` (PK organisation_id, columns value_1..value_8); per-business card shows big teal pills for each non-empty value (up to 8) in a responsive grid; empty state "No core values recorded yet."
  - `account-focus.html` — reads `core_focus`; two-column layout (Purpose / Niche) that stacks on narrow screens, each in a teal-bordered block with uppercase label.
  - `account-targets.html` — reads `targets`; three sections — 10-Year Vision (text), 3-Year Picture (date/revenue/profit financial row + description), 1-Year Plan (date/revenue/profit row + numbered goals list).
  - `account-marketing.html` — reads `marketing_strategy`; four sections — Target Market, What Makes Us Different (numbered list from `uniques`), Our Process, Our Guarantee.
  - `account-leadership.html` — reads `leadership_team_members` (multi-row per org, ordered by `sort_order`, filtering out `placeholder = true`); list of name (navy bold) · role (teal bold) with responsibilities below.
- **Planning ×3:**
  - `account-annual.html` — reads `annual_sessions`; list ordered most-recent-first with date + year + status pill (green/amber/grey for completed/in_progress/scheduled) + "Areas completed: X of Y" computed from `areas_completed` jsonb (4 areas assumed).
  - `account-quarterly.html` — same shape as annual but uses `target_quarter` instead of year and 3 areas assumed.
  - `account-checkins.html` — reads `team_checkins`; 3-tile stat row (submissions count, overall avg score / 5, most recent submission date) + latest 3 contributors with their average scores. Defensive handling of empty `scores` arrays so a missing-data submission won't crash averaging.
- **Operations ×4:**
  - `account-numbers.html` — reads `scorecard_metrics` ordered by `sort_order`, then a single batched `scorecard_entries` query (`.in('metric_id', metricIds)`, descending by `week_date`) grouped client-side into the metricId → entries map. Per-business table: Metric · Owner | Goal | Most recent value | Last 4 weeks trend.
  - `account-goals.html` — reads `rocks`, filters to current quarter (computed in JS as `Q{n} YYYY`). Top of card: current quarter label + "X on track of Y total" summary. Each row: description (with 🏢 prefix for `company_rock`) + owner + colored status pill (done=green / on_track=teal / at_risk=amber / off_track=red / not_started=grey).
  - `account-meetings.html` — reads `meetings`, descending by `meeting_date`, capped at 10 per business. Each row: date + quarter + status pill + rating (only when status='completed' and rating set) + 1-line notes preview.
  - `account-issues.html` — reads `issues` filtered to `status='open'`, descending by `created_at`. Top banner: "Open issues: X". Each row: description + owner + raised date. Empty state celebrates: "No open issues for this business. 🎉"
- **Hub pages updated:** `account-strategy.html` (5 cards), `account-planning.html` (3 cards), and `account-operations.html` (4 cards) — all 12 previously coming-soon cards flipped to available. Pattern: removed `.coming-soon` modifier class and replaced `<span class="soon-pill">Coming soon</span>` with `<span class="act-arrow">›</span>`, matching the existing available-card style on the business-level hubs.
- **Data layer reality:** most worksheet/operations pages still save to localStorage; the Supabase tables exist (per `supabase/schema.sql`) but most queries currently return zero rows. Every new page shows the same yellow data-layer-pending banner as `account-plans.html` when all businesses return empty, with the per-page worksheet name customised. The banner disappears as soon as any business has real Supabase data.
- **Carousel edge cases:** zero businesses → "Create your first business" link to `setup.html`; one business → no prev/next buttons, just the single card; 2+ businesses → full carousel with dots + keyboard nav (arrow keys ignored when typing in inputs/textareas).

---

## v0.5.95
- **Removed the 4 hub cards from `my-businesses.html`.** They duplicated the bottom-nav added in v0.5.94 — same labels, same destinations, just bigger and higher up the page. With the bottom-nav doing the navigation, the dashboard is cleaner and the focus shifts back to what actually belongs on a dashboard: account info, stats, business snapshots, and team management.
- Dashboard now renders: account header (SARUBA + Rename) → stats row (Businesses / Users / Open Issues / Goals On Track) → per-business snapshot grid → users / team section.
- Dead CSS (`.hub-section`, `.hub-grid`, `.hub-card`, `.hub-icon`, `.hub-text`, `.hub-name`, `.hub-desc`, `.hub-arrow`) stripped from the style block. The 4 account hub pages (`account-strategy.html` etc.) are unchanged and still reachable from the bottom-nav.

---

## v0.5.94
- **Bottom-nav added to the account-level pages**, matching the business app's pattern. Same 5-item layout: Home / Planning / Strategy / Operations / Learn. The user request: "Build the 4 headings the same way you have in the others. Down the bottom." Confirmed the right destinations for each item.
- **Added to:**
  - `my-businesses.html` — active = Home
  - `account-strategy.html` — active = Strategy
  - `account-planning.html` — active = Planning
  - `account-operations.html` — active = Operations
- **Destinations:**
  - Home → `my-businesses.html` (account dashboard)
  - Planning → `account-planning.html`
  - Strategy → `account-strategy.html`
  - Operations → `account-operations.html`
  - Learn → `learning-vault.html` (shared with business app — learning content isn't business-scoped)
- **Not added to leaf carousel pages** like `account-plans.html` — those follow the `one-page-plan.html` pattern (sticky toolbar with "← Account" back-link replaces the bottom-nav, since the carousel UI needs vertical space at the bottom).
- `.container { padding-bottom: 90px; }` on the 4 nav-enabled pages so content doesn't hide behind the nav.

---

## v0.5.93
- **Account-level navigation now mirrors the business app's structure.** The owner's mental model is consistent: SARUBA (account) is structured like a single business — Planning, Strategy, Operations, Learn — just rolled up across every business.
- **`my-businesses.html` restructure:** the 16-card topic launcher is replaced with a clean **4-card hub grid** (Planning / Strategy / Operations / Learn). Bigger cards, accent border, icon + name + description + arrow — same visual language as `strategy.html` / `operations.html` / `planning.html` but more prominent (these are top-level navigation). Card order matches the business app's bottom-nav: Planning, Strategy, Operations, Learn.
- **3 new account-level hub pages** mirroring the business hubs:
  - `account-strategy.html` — copies `strategy.html`. CTA: "View One-Page Plans — All Businesses" (live). Cards: Core Values / Core Focus / Targets / Marketing Strategy / Leadership Team (all coming-soon).
  - `account-planning.html` — copies `planning.html`. Cards: Annual Planning / Quarterly Planning / Team Check-ins (all coming-soon).
  - `account-operations.html` — copies `operations.html`. Cards: Weekly Numbers / Quarter Goals / Meetings / Issues (all coming-soon).
- Each new hub uses the same `.activity-card` pattern as the business hubs, with a `.coming-soon` modifier (opacity 0.55, pointer-events: none, "Coming soon" pill, neutral border). Identical auth gate + Sign Out wiring.
- **"Learn" on the dashboard** links directly to `learning-vault.html` (no account-level hub needed — learning content is shared across all businesses).
- **Architecture is now 3 levels:**
  1. **Account dashboard** (`my-businesses.html`) — header + stats + 4 hub cards + businesses snapshot + users
  2. **Account hub pages** (`account-strategy.html` etc.) — list of cross-business views inside that theme
  3. **Account leaf pages** (`account-plans.html` etc.) — carousel: one business at a time with arrows/dots/keyboard nav
- All 4 hub-card destinations work. Only 1 of 12 leaf pages (`account-plans.html`) is built; the rest follow the same carousel template.

---

## v0.5.92
- **`account-plans.html` switched from "stack all businesses" to a carousel** — one business' one-pager visible at a time, arrows to step through. The v0.5.91 stacked-vertically approach was wrong: scrolling through 3 full one-pagers stacked is overwhelming, and the mental model is "look at one, then look at the next", not "see them all at once".
- **Carousel UI:**
  - Top nav bar (white card, navy buttons): **← Prev (Business name)** | _Current Business Name_ + "Business X of Y" + dot indicators | **(Business name) Next →**
  - The prev/next buttons preview the next/previous business name as a hint inside the button itself.
  - Dot indicators below the counter — click a dot to jump straight to that business.
  - Keyboard `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowRight` to step through (ignored when typing in inputs/textareas).
  - Single business in account → no arrows, just the name + "Your only business" line.
- **Print now prints just the current view** (not all businesses) — `@media print` hides the carousel nav + intro + banner + toolbar, so you get exactly the one one-pager you're looking at as a single landscape A4 page.
- All other v0.5.91 behaviour preserved: Supabase queries scoped to caller's orgs, empty-field placeholders, yellow data-layer-pending banner when all businesses return empty, "← Account" back link.

---

## v0.5.91
- **New page: `account-plans.html` — cross-business One-Page Plans view.** The first real cross-business topic page; the proof-of-concept for the topic launcher (v0.5.89).
- **Use case:** owner running a board / strategy meeting wants to see every business' one-pager side-by-side without drilling into each one individually. Topic-first navigation: "I want to compare plans" → not "I want to open Business A, then Business B".
- **Layout:** account-level page (no business bottom-nav, no "← Home" — "← Account" back link to `my-businesses.html`). Stacked vertically: one compact one-pager card per business, in alphabetical order by name. Each card reuses the same 3-column layout as the per-business `one-page-plan.html` (Who We Are / Where We Are Going / How We Go to Market).
- **Data flow:** loads the caller's active `team_members` rows, then fires 5 parallel Supabase queries scoped to that orgId set — `core_values`, `core_focus`, `targets`, `marketing_strategy`, `leadership_team_members`. Builds a per-org data map and renders one card per business. Empty fields render as muted italic "— not recorded —" placeholders instead of looking broken.
- **Data-layer reality:** worksheet pages still save to localStorage (Supabase wiring lands in v0.5.94). So today the cross-business view will show every business as empty. To make this obvious rather than confusing, when every business returns zero strategy data the page shows a yellow banner: "Heads up: strategy worksheets currently save locally on each business. Once the data layer migration lands (v0.5.94), edits sync to Supabase and this page populates automatically."
- **Print:** landscape A4, page-break-after each business so a 3-business account prints to 3 pages. Toolbar Print/PDF button. Mobile shows a teal hint to scroll right inside each plan card for the 3-column doc.
- **Topic launcher update:** `account-plans.html` card on `my-businesses.html` flipped from `coming-soon` to `available` with an "Open" pill. 4 available cards on the dashboard now: Learning Vault, Businesses, Team, One-Page Plans. 12 still coming-soon (the rest of the cross-business pages).
- **Why this one first:** validates the navigation pattern (topic-first, account-level page, "← Account" back link), the visual pattern (compact card per business), and the data pattern (parallel queries scoped to orgId set, empty-state handling, banner for data-layer-pending). The remaining 12 cross-business pages follow the same template.

---

## v0.5.90
- **Topic launcher fix — Businesses & Team are now `available` cards, not "Coming soon".** The v0.5.89 agent over-applied the "only Learning Vault is clickable" rule and marked all three "Learning & Account" cards as coming-soon. But the Businesses and Team sections exist right below on the same page — their `#businesses` and `#team` anchors are real navigation, not future work. Flipped both cards from `class="topic-card coming-soon"` to `class="topic-card available"` with an "Open" pill.
- Dashboard now has **3 available topic cards** (Learning Vault → `learning-vault.html`, Businesses → `#businesses` anchor, Team → `#team` anchor) and **13 coming-soon** (the cross-business pages still to be built in v0.5.91+).
- No other functional changes. VERSION / `sw.js` / `index.html` footer all bumped to v0.5.90 per the convention.

---

## v0.5.89
- **SARUBA dashboard restructured from a per-business snapshot view into a topic launcher.** `my-businesses.html` now leads with **14 topic cards** organised into 4 themed sections — Strategy / Operations / Planning / Learning & Account — each card a future cross-business view (e.g. "see Core Values for every business side-by-side"). This is the structural step; the actual cross-business pages get built one-by-one in v0.5.90+.
- **Topic card sections** (14 cards total):
  - **📋 Strategy** (6): One-Page Plans, Core Values, Core Focus, Targets, Marketing, Leadership
  - **🎯 Operations** (4): Quarter Goals, Weekly Numbers, Issues, Meetings
  - **🗓️ Planning** (3): Annual Sessions, Quarterly Sessions, Team Check-ins
  - **📚 Learning & Account** (3): Learning Vault, Businesses, Team
- **Topic card states**:
  - **`.coming-soon`** — opacity 0.55, `pointer-events: none`, grey "Coming soon" pill. All 13 cross-business cards.
  - **`.available`** — full opacity, hover lift, teal "Open" pill. **Learning Vault → `learning-vault.html`** + Businesses / Team → scroll-anchor to existing sections on the same page (`#businesses`, `#team`).
- **Destination URLs locked in** for the future cards so v0.5.90+ only has to ship the pages: `account-plans.html`, `account-values.html`, `account-focus.html`, `account-targets.html`, `account-marketing.html`, `account-leadership.html`, `account-goals.html`, `account-numbers.html`, `account-issues.html`, `account-meetings.html`, `account-annual.html`, `account-quarterly.html`, `account-checkins.html`.
- **Account-level scoping cleaned up** — `my-businesses.html` no longer has the business-tools bottom-nav (Home / Planning / Strategy / Operations / Learn) or the "← Home" back link in the site-header. The account dashboard is the top of the hierarchy; there's nothing above. Header is now just **"Account"** + Sign Out.
- **Business dashboard (`index.html`) gains a "← Account" back link** so users can navigate upward from their business view to SARUBA. Other per-business pages (planning.html, strategy.html, operations.html, all worksheets, all tools) keep their existing "← Home" back link — those still point to the business dashboard, which is correct.
- **Existing snapshot cards + team section retained** below the topic launcher (now anchored at `#businesses` and `#team`) so the v0.5.88 snapshot view is still one scroll away. Per-business cards keep their snapshot grid, ⋮ menu (Rename / Delete), and "Open ›" button — full v0.5.88 functionality intact, just no longer the centrepiece.
- **CSS additions**: `.topic-section`, `.topic-section-title`, `.topic-grid`, `.topic-card`, `.topic-card.coming-soon`, `.topic-card.available`, `.coming-soon-pill`, `.available-pill`. Responsive grid: 3 cols desktop, 2 cols tablet, 1 col phone.
- No SQL changes. No data layer changes.

## v0.5.88
- **SARUBA account dashboard rebuilt as an owner's snapshot view.** `my-businesses.html` used to be a business-list switcher (name + role pill + Open ›). It's now a real overview surface so the account holder sees "what's going on across my businesses" without drilling in.
- **Stats row expanded from 2 to 4 tiles**: Businesses / Users / **Open Issues** (NEW — account-level sum of `issues.status='open'` across every org the caller is in) / **Goals On Track** (NEW — `<onTrack>/<total>` rocks for the current quarter, summed across all orgs). Tiles wrap to a 2×2 grid under 480px.
- **Per-business cards are now snapshot "report cards"** with a 3-cell grid (stacks to 1 column under 600px):
  - **📊 Revenue (1yr)** — `targets.one_year_revenue` (e.g. "$420K") or "Not set"
  - **🎯 Quarter Goals** — `<onTrack> of <total>` rocks for `Q<n> YYYY` (current quarter format) or "0 of 0"
  - **⚠️ Open Issues** — count of `issues.status='open'` for that org
  - **📅 Next meeting** line below the grid — earliest `meetings.meeting_date` where status ≠ 'completed' AND date ≥ today, formatted as "Mon 19 May", or "None scheduled"
- **Fetching strategy**: a single `Promise.all` batches 5 queries (memberships team rows + the 4 new snapshot tables). Each of the snapshot queries uses `.in('organisation_id', orgIds)` — so it stays at 1 round-trip per table regardless of how many businesses the user has. Results are grouped client-side into a `snapshotByOrg` Map for O(1) lookup per card.
- **Goals on-track logic**: a rock counts as on-track if `status IN ('on_track','done','complete')` — matches the existing seed-data values.
- **Empty-state handling**: every snapshot field renders gracefully when the underlying tables return zero rows (still localStorage-backed in most pages). Revenue → "Not set", Goals → "0 of 0", Issues → "0", Next meeting → "None scheduled". No errors, no broken UI.
- **Header tweaks**: "Account overview — what's happening across your businesses." subhead replaces the previous "Manage every business and teammate". Section header is now "Your Businesses" / "Your Team (N)" — added a header-aligned `+ New Business` and `+ Invite User` button next to each section title for quicker access (the wide CTA buttons at the bottom of each section are unchanged).
- All admin-only functionality preserved: ⋮ menu (Rename / Delete), `bootstrap_organisation` / `rename_business` / `delete_business` / `invite_team_member` / `remove_team_member` RPC calls, `Open ›` → set active org + `index.html` navigation, "Rename account ›" link. No SQL changes — all schema already exists from v0.5.79 + v0.5.84.

## v0.5.87
- **Removed "Seats: X of Y" stat tile** from the SARUBA account dashboard. It duplicated the Users tile in plan-capacity framing — "1 of 3" felt ambiguous (status? error?). The stats row is now a clean 2-tile grid: **Businesses** + **Users**. Seat-allowance / billing context can surface later in a proper "Account / Billing" section when Stripe is wired up.

## v0.5.86
- **Removed the "Active" pill from `my-businesses.html` business cards.** Previously the page auto-marked one business as "Active" on every visit (the localStorage-default selection), which felt like phantom state — implied a business was open even when the user had just logged in and not done anything. Now the account dashboard is a clean list with role pills only. Users tap "Open ›" on a card to enter that business. The underlying `coach4u_active_org_id` localStorage mechanism is unchanged and still drives which business `index.html` and other tools load when navigated to directly.

## v0.5.85
- **Account dashboard is the first landing page after sign-in.** `login.html` now redirects to `my-businesses.html` (was `index.html`) on a successful sign-in AND when an existing session is detected. Every user lands on their SARUBA parent dashboard first, seeing all businesses, can switch into one, manage users, etc. before drilling into a specific business's data.
- **First-run guard added to `my-businesses.html`**: if a signed-in user has zero active `team_members` rows, the page auto-redirects to `setup.html` so the new-user wizard still fires. Avoids the awkward "empty businesses list" state for brand-new users.

## v0.5.84
- **SARUBA account dashboard** — `my-businesses.html` rebuilt from a simple switcher into the comprehensive parent dashboard:
  - Account header (existing — shows the subscription name)
  - **Stats row** (NEW) — 3 tiles: Businesses count, Users count (de-duplicated across the user's admin orgs + pending invites), Seats used / total
  - **Businesses section** — each card now has a "•••" menu (admin-only) with Rename and Delete actions. Click the row body to switch into that business and go to the dashboard
  - **Users section** (NEW) — lists all teammates the caller can see, grouped by user, with a role-pill per business + × to remove. "+ Invite User" button at section header opens a modal: email + display name + role + checkbox list of admin businesses to grant access to. Pending invites show with a "pending" pill until the invited person signs up.
- **5 new Supabase RPC functions** (`SECURITY DEFINER`, granted to `authenticated`):
  - `invite_team_member(business_id, email, role, display_name)` — admin-only. Creates `team_members` row. If the email already maps to an `auth.users` id, sets `user_id` + `status='active'` immediately. Otherwise stores `invited_email` + `status='pending'`.
  - `remove_team_member(member_id)` — admin-only. Soft-removes by setting `status='removed'`. Prevents removing yourself if you're the sole admin.
  - `rename_business(business_id, new_name)` — admin-only. `UPDATE organisations SET name = …`.
  - `delete_business(business_id)` — admin + subscription owner. `DELETE FROM organisations`. Cascades all team_members + domain data.
  - `link_pending_invites()` — trigger function on `auth.users INSERT`. Auto-converts pending invites matching the new user's email into active memberships.
- **Routing change**: in `index.html`, if the user has >1 membership AND no valid active org is selected, redirect to `my-businesses.html`. Single-business users still go straight to their dashboard. This makes the parent dashboard the natural landing page for multi-business users.

### SQL delta to paste
The new SQL is already appended to `supabase/schema.sql`. To apply, you can either re-paste the whole file (idempotent — DROP block at top handles re-runs) or paste just the new functions from lines 730 onwards.

## v0.5.83
- **Parent account / business hierarchy introduced.**
  - `subscriptions` now has a `name` column representing the account / license-holder name (e.g. "SARUBA").
  - Organisations under it are the operational businesses (e.g. "Coach4U Coaching", "Coach4U Development").
- **Two new Supabase RPC functions:**
  - `bootstrap_account_and_business(account_name, business_name)` — called by `setup.html` on first signup. Creates the subscription with the account name, creates the first organisation, makes the user the admin in one transaction.
  - `update_account_name(new_name)` — called by the "Rename account" modal on `my-businesses.html` so existing users can set their account name.
- **`setup.html` now asks for two names**: account / company (parent) + first business. Submits to `bootstrap_account_and_business`, redirects to `my-businesses.html` (the parent dashboard) instead of straight to the business dashboard.
- **`my-businesses.html` becomes the parent dashboard:**
  - Shows the account name at the top as the page heading.
  - "Rename account ›" link in the header opens a modal that calls `update_account_name`. Shows "Set account name" if the name is still null (handles existing v0.5.81 users).
- **Dashboard "Manage businesses ›" link relabelled to "Account dashboard ›"** to match the parent/child mental model.
- **`supabase/schema.sql` needs re-running OR a small delta** — chat message has the SQL delta block.

## v0.5.82
- **Dashboard "Manage businesses" link always visible.** Previously the link was only rendered when the user belonged to 2+ businesses, leaving single-business users with no in-app way to reach `my-businesses.html` to add their second business. Now the link always shows, with adaptive label: "Switch business ›" if the user has 2+ orgs, "Manage businesses ›" if they have 1.

## v0.5.81
- **New page `my-businesses.html`** — lists every organisation the user is an active member of with role pill, highlights the current active one, and has a "+ Create New Business" modal that calls the existing `bootstrap_organisation` RPC (handles both first business and additional). Tapping a different business sets it active and redirects back to the dashboard.
- **New helper `js/active-org.js`** — tiny module exposing `window.activeOrg.get() / set(orgId) / clear()` backed by `localStorage.coach4u_active_org_id`. Loaded via `<script defer>` on every page that needs to know which business is currently selected.
- **`index.html` (dashboard) extended**:
  - Resolves the user's team memberships on load.
  - Picks the active org (stored selection if still valid, else first).
  - Shows the business name at the top of the dashboard (replaces the static "Business Dashboard" heading).
  - Shows a "Switch business ›" link below the date when the user belongs to more than one business — link goes to `my-businesses.html`.
- **`setup.html`** sets the newly-created org as active immediately after creation, so the user lands on the dashboard with the correct business pre-selected.
- `sw.js` precache adds `js/active-org.js`.
- **Data layer still on localStorage** — every tool reads/writes localStorage as before. v0.5.83 will wire each tool's `api()` to read Supabase scoped by active org.

## v0.5.80
- **First-business setup flow.** New `setup.html` page asks a brand-new user for their business name. On submit it calls a single Supabase RPC (`bootstrap_organisation`) that creates the user's `subscriptions` row + first `organisations` row + admin `team_members` row in one transaction.
- **`bootstrap_organisation(business_name text)` function** added to `supabase/schema.sql`. Marked SECURITY DEFINER so it can write the bootstrap rows that the user's own RLS policies would block (you can't INSERT a team_member admin row when you have no admin team_member row yet). Also handles the case where a user already has a subscription and just wants to add another business — same function, different code path. Granted to the `authenticated` role only.
- **`index.html` auth flow extended.** After the membership-status check, it now looks up `team_members` for the user. If there's no active row, redirect to `setup.html`. Means existing accounts (no team_member yet) hit the wizard the next time they sign in.
- **`supabase/README.md` updated** to document the new bootstrap function with a JS call example.
- **App code still on localStorage for the data tools** — the wizard creates real Supabase rows but the worksheets / sessions / tools all keep using localStorage until v0.5.83.

## v0.5.79
- **Supabase schema written.** `supabase/schema.sql` is a complete clean-slate migration:
  - **DROPs** the old EOS-style tables (`businesses`, `vto`, `rocks`, `scorecard_metrics`, `scorecard_entries`, `meetings`, `meeting_headlines`, `meeting_todos`, `issues`, `seats`, `members`, `values_ratings`, `gwc_ratings`, `user_modules`, `organisations`). Preserves `public.users` (the membership-status gate).
  - **CREATEs** the new team-scoped schema: `subscriptions` (account-level), `organisations`, `team_members`; 5 strategy tables (`core_values`, `core_focus`, `targets`, `marketing_strategy`, `leadership_team_members`); operations (`scorecard_metrics`, `scorecard_entries`, `rocks`, `issues`); meetings (`meetings`, `meeting_headlines`, `meeting_todos`); planning sessions (`annual_sessions`, `quarterly_sessions`); `team_checkins`.
  - **RLS enabled** on every domain table. Two helper functions (`public.user_org_ids(uid)` and `public.user_admin_org_ids(uid)`) make every policy compact. Pattern: members read everything in their orgs; admins write. `team_checkins` is the only domain table where members can INSERT (submit their own check-in); everything else is admin-write.
  - **Indexes** on every FK + commonly-queried columns (subscription_id, organisation_id, quarter, session_date, week_date).
  - **One convenience view** (`v_active_team`) joining team_members + auth.users.users + organisations.
- **`supabase/README.md`** added with paste-and-run instructions + a quick RLS test you can run to verify policies work end-to-end.
- **App code unchanged** — still on localStorage. Wiring tools to Supabase queries begins at v0.5.83.

## v0.5.78
- **Captured the launch pricing model in CLAUDE.md.** New "Pricing Model" section locks in: $150/mo base license (1 business + 3 users included), $75/mo per additional business, $60/mo per additional user.
- **Global-user principle** explicitly documented: one person who's a member of 3 businesses still counts as 1 seat. Matches Notion / Slack / Linear conventions.
- **Schema implication captured**: `subscriptions` table lives at the account level (one subscription per buyer, owns N organisations). Replaces the per-org `seat_count` from the v0.5.75 schema sketch.
- Worked examples included for solo / small team / IAS-style holding / larger configurations.
- Docs-only change — no code touched.

## v0.5.77
- **`sw.js` precache trimmed.** Removed the UMD Supabase CDN URL (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2/dist/umd/supabase.min.js`) — every page consumes the ESM bundle since v0.5.76, so the UMD entry was dead bytes in the precache.

## v0.5.76
- **Pre-Supabase migration cleanup** — fixed all 10 items from the v0.5.74 audit so the codebase is clean before the Supabase data layer is wired in:
  1. **Session shape divergence resolved.** `coach4u_annual_sessions` and `coach4u_quarterly_sessions` now use ONE shape everywhere: `{ id, session_date, year/target_quarter, status, attendance, areas_completed }`. Dropped `agenda` + `rating` from index.html `ensureSeeds()`, the "+ New …" creators in `annual-sessions.html` / `quarterly-sessions.html`, the self-seeds in the run-session pages, and the `${s.rating ? '· …/10' : ''}` list-row fragments.
  2. **Meeting seed status aligned.** Meeting id 4001 is now `status:'completed'` in all 3 places (`index.html` ensureSeeds + `meeting.html` self-seed + `run-meeting.html` self-seed) with matching rating + notes.
  3. **Sign-out class fixed on 5 Ops pages.** `scorecard.html`, `goals.html`, `meeting.html`, `run-meeting.html`, `issues.html` were using `class="signOutBtn"` (rendered unstyled — only `.sign-out-btn` is in CSS). Now all use canonical `class="sign-out-btn" id="signOutBtn"`.
  4. **Dead links fixed.** `learn/values-discovery.html` final CTA → `../core-values.html` (was `../strategy/core-values.html` from before v0.5.45). `404.html` secondary button → `/index.html` (was `/dashboard.html`).
  5. **`ensureSeeds()` now seeds 4 previously-missing keys.** Dashboard pre-seeds `coach4u_core_focus`, `coach4u_marketing_strategy`, `coach4u_leadership_team`, `coach4u_demo_scorecard` (metrics + 6 weeks of sample entries) on first visit, using the same shapes the worksheet/tool pages expect.
  6. **`membership_status` check added to 10 pages.** Was missing on `planning.html`, all 5 Operations tools (`scorecard / goals / meeting / run-meeting / issues`), and all 4 Planning session pages (`annual-sessions / run-annual-session / quarterly-sessions / run-quarterly-session`). Inactive users could deep-link in; now they bounce to `inactive.html`.
  7. **`sw.js` precache cleaned.** Removed non-existent `dashboard.html`. Added `favicon.svg` + `js/active-session.js`. Removed dead `js/auth.js` + `js/supabase.js` entries.
  8. **Supabase SDK consolidated to ESM.** Converted 9 files from UMD (`<script src="…/umd/supabase.min.js">` + `window.supabase.createClient`) to ESM (`<script type="module">` + `import { createClient } from '…/+esm'`). Pages affected: `scorecard / goals / meeting / run-meeting / issues / annual-sessions / quarterly-sessions / run-annual-session / run-quarterly-session`. No inline `onclick` handlers needed migration (all event wiring is `addEventListener` based). `team-checkin.html` does not use Supabase and was untouched.
  9. **Dead JS files removed.** `js/auth.js` and `js/supabase.js` deleted (referenced by no HTML); now only `js/active-session.js` remains.
  10. **Aggregated team check-in results re-introduced.** Both `run-annual-session.html` and `run-quarterly-session.html` now show, below the Copy Link / Open Form buttons: "{N} team responses received" (or "No responses yet"), and when N>0 a compact table — one row per question (truncated to ~80 chars) with average score + red/amber/green dot (red < 3, amber 3–3.9, green ≥ 4), sorted lowest-average first — plus a "Show individual comments" expander grouping comments by question with the submitter's name. The 17 EOS-style `CHECKIN_QUESTIONS` array is duplicated into both run-session files so the questions can be displayed (Supabase migration will make this a server-side constant).
- Version bump: 0.5.75 → 0.5.76. `CACHE_VERSION` in `sw.js` bumped to `coach4u-v0.5.76`. `CLAUDE.md` "Pre-migration cleanup required" subsection removed from the Planned Architecture block (those items are done).

## v0.5.75
- **Documented the planned Supabase team architecture in CLAUDE.md.** Locked-in decisions:
  - **2-tier roles**: Admin (manages seats, edits all data, sends invites) vs. Member (reads team data, fills check-ins only).
  - **Subscription model**: a business buys N seats; first buyer is Admin; Admin allocates seats by email invite.
  - **Team-scoped data**: every data table scoped by `organisation_id`; all team members see ONE shared dataset (One-Page Plan, sessions, scorecard, etc.). Replaces the per-user assumption baked into today's localStorage.
  - **Check-in flow**: Admin schedules session → emails invite link to members → members log in + submit → aggregated results visible to **everyone on the team** (max-transparency model) for setting planning priorities. This reverses the v0.5.73 simplification (which stripped the aggregated results because the form was thought to be public; now that it's authenticated + team-scoped, the aggregation comes back).
- Captured the pre-migration cleanup checklist from the v0.5.74 audit (10 items) into CLAUDE.md so it's not lost.
- Docs-only change — no code touched.

## v0.5.74
- **Restructured project docs.** Moved full version history out of `CLAUDE.md` into `CHANGELOG.md` (this file). CLAUDE.md is now lean project memory + conventions + planned architecture; this file is the version log.
- Tightened `CLAUDE.md` Key Rules: added canonical sign-out ID (`signOutBtn` + class `sign-out-btn`), 300ms debounce convention for auto-save text inputs, explicit no-Google-Fonts rule, and a Supabase key-exposure note (anon key is intentionally publishable; security via RLS; never commit `service_role`).
- Listed all 4 version-sync targets explicitly (CLAUDE.md / VERSION / sw.js / index.html footer label).
- Clarified the team-checkin question count: 17 rated statements + 1 required name field + 1 optional role field (was reported as "17 questions" / "18 questions" depending on whether the name field was counted).
- Documented that the repo is intentionally public (GitHub Pages) and the Supabase anon key in the file is the `sb_publishable_*` variant.

## v0.5.73
- **Planning session workspaces simplified to attendance + checklist + share link.** Both `run-annual-session.html` and `run-quarterly-session.html` previously had a multi-step agenda accordion with per-step notes textareas, a 1–10 session-rating step, a "Review Team Check-in" agenda step, and a big inline aggregated check-in results table at the top. Stripped all of that.
- New workspace shape (both files): **status dropdown + timer**, then a **📋 Attendance** block (single textarea, debounced ~300ms auto-save), then **✅ Areas to Cover** (one checkbox per area with the existing Strategy/Goals deep-links inline beside each row + a "{n} of {total} areas completed" progress hint), then a **🌟 Team Check-in** block reduced to two buttons — **Copy Check-in Link** (teal, clipboard + toast) and **Open Form** (secondary). No count, no aggregated table, no comments view.
- **Annual** workspace has 4 areas: Review Last Year / Refresh Core Values + Core Focus / Update 10-Year + 3-Year Picture / Set 1-Year Plan + Q1 Goals. **Quarterly** has 3 areas: Review Last Quarter / Lessons + Adjustments / Set Next Quarter's Goals.
- **Persistence** — two new fields on each session object: `attendance: '<string>'` and `areas_completed: { [areaId]: boolean }`. Attendance saves debounced on input; checkboxes save immediately.
- Removed CSS / JS: `.rating-btns`, `.rating-btn`, `.notes-textarea`, `.ci-table`, `.ci-dot*`, `.ci-comments`, `.ci-q`, `.ci-c`, `.checkin-empty`, `.label-sm`, `.agenda-*` rules; `loadCheckins`, `aggregate`, `renderCheckinResultsTable`, `renderCheckinComments`, `updateAgendaNotes`, `buildAgendaSteps`, `priorQuarter` helpers.

## v0.5.72
- **Team Check-in form added.** A new public, auth-free page `team-checkin.html` lets team members rate organisational health statements (EOS-style) before each Annual or Quarterly planning session. The leader copies a per-session link (`team-checkin.html?session=<id>&type=annual|quarterly`) from the session workspace and shares it.
- **Form structure**: required name field + optional role field + **17 rated statements** (1–5 Likert, 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree) + optional comment per question.
- **17 statements** cover vision, core focus, 10-year + 3-year targets, accountability chart, "right seat", leadership trust, issue solving, weekly meetings, quarterly priorities, annual meetings, core values hiring/firing, "right people", mentoring/coaching, strengths-based culture, and thriving culture.
- **Database-ready JSON**. Submissions write to localStorage under `coach4u_team_checkins` as `{ id, session_id, session_type, name, role, submitted_at, scores: number[17], comments: string[17] }` — same shape that will post to a future Supabase `team_checkins` table.
- **Workspace aggregation** added in v0.5.72 but later removed in v0.5.73 in favour of the slim share-link block.

## v0.5.71
- **Floating Resume Planning Session pill.** When you tap Start Session on an Annual or Quarterly Planning workspace, a teal pill appears bottom-center on every page in the app. Tap it to return to the in-progress session. Clears automatically when you mark the session completed or click End Session.
- Implemented as a shared `js/active-session.js` loaded via `<script defer>` on every main page (21 pages).
- Exposes `window.activeSession.set()` / `clear()` used by the two `run-*-session.html` workspaces. localStorage key: `coach4u_active_planning_session`.

## v0.5.70
- **`planning.html` restructured as a standard hub** to match the Strategy and Operations layout. Dropped the vertical flow visualisation; replaced with the same `activity-card` pattern.
- Top: "View One-Page Plan" teal CTA. Below: 2 activity cards — Annual Planning → `annual-sessions.html`, Quarterly Planning → `quarterly-sessions.html`.

## v0.5.69
- **Planning is now actionable, not just a diagram.** 4 new pages built on the same pattern as `meeting.html` + `run-meeting.html`:
  - `annual-sessions.html` — list of past + scheduled annual planning sessions
  - `run-annual-session.html` — single-session workspace (originally 5-step agenda; simplified in v0.5.73)
  - `quarterly-sessions.html` — list of past + scheduled quarterly sessions; "+ New" modal asks which quarter
  - `run-quarterly-session.html` — single-session workspace (originally 4-step agenda; simplified in v0.5.73)
- localStorage keys: `coach4u_annual_sessions` (array), `coach4u_quarterly_sessions` (array). No nested wrapper.
- Seed data: annual list seeds 1 completed + 1 scheduled. Quarterly list seeds 2 completed + 1 scheduled.
- `planning.html` cards repointed; `index.html` `ensureSeeds()` extended.

## v0.5.68
- **Planning page collapsed from 5 sessions to 4.** The "Q1 Review" was redundant — the Annual Planning session already produces the Q1 plan.
- New flow: Annual Planning (sets year + Q1) → Q2 Planning Session → Q3 Planning Session → Q4 Planning Session → cycles back.

## v0.5.67
- **Leadership Team moved INTO the One-Page Plan body** so the plan fits on a single A4 landscape page when printed. Lives as a compact field at the bottom of the "Who We Are" column. Empty placeholder rows filtered out.

## v0.5.66
Final polish on `planning.html`:
- Fixed sign-out button class regression. Bottom nav font aligned with other pages.
- Subtitle tightened; stage labels simplified; Annual node balanced with a "Reviews" row; "Start Here" chip added; "View One-Page Plan" CTA at top.

## v0.5.65
Audit fixes for consistency across all pages:
- Hub titles simplified — `strategy.html` "Build Your Strategy" → "Strategy", `operations.html` "Run Your Operations" → "Operations".
- Goals header-title → "Quarterly Goals".
- **Sign-out button id standardised to `signOutBtn` across all 17 pages.** (Some used `sign-out-btn` kebab-case.)
- Google Fonts purged from `offline.html`, `404.html`, `inactive.html`, `forgot-password.html`.
- "Next Meeting" stat tile on the dashboard now opens `run-meeting.html?id=X` directly.

## v0.5.64
- **Consistent hint box across all 9 worksheets/tools.** Every Strategy worksheet and Operations tool now has the same pattern: subtitle + one minimal `.ws-hint` with a single Learning Vault link.
- `.ws-hint` promoted to shared `css/style.css`.

## v0.5.63
- **Text-clipping audit on worksheets.** Added `autoGrow(textarea)` helper to resize each textarea to its `scrollHeight`.
- Marketing Strategy "Our Guarantee" field converted from `<input>` to `<textarea rows="2">`.

## v0.5.62
- **Robust seed merging.** `loadData()` and dashboard `seedIfEmpty()` now use a **merge-missing-keys** strategy: any SEED key that's `undefined` in the stored object gets filled in (intentional empty strings are preserved).
- Core Values worksheet now lists 8 values (was 5); seed still fills 1–5.

## v0.5.61
- **Dashboard panels are now fully live.** Every clickable tile and panel on `index.html` reads from localStorage instead of hardcoded sample text (Open Issues, Goals On Track, Next Meeting, 1-Year Goal, Core Values, This Week todos, This Quarter rocks).
- Pre-seed on first visit via `ensureSeeds()` — writes seeded defaults to all localStorage keys ONLY if missing.

## v0.5.60
- **Strategy worksheets now persist edits and seed dummy data.** All 4 Strategy worksheets auto-save every field edit to localStorage and seed realistic example content on first visit.
  - Keys: `coach4u_core_values`, `coach4u_core_focus`, `coach4u_targets`, `coach4u_marketing_strategy` (plus existing `coach4u_leadership_team`).
- **`one-page-plan.html` now reflects worksheet edits.** Each field on the printable plan got a stable `id`; `applyWorksheetData()` reads the localStorage keys and overrides hardcoded HTML where data exists.

## Earlier History (v0.5.9 – v0.5.59) — Summary
Pre-v0.5.60 milestones, compressed:
